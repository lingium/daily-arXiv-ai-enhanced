Coupling\nthese formulations with two popular and complementary black-box adversarial\nalgorithms, we systematically evaluate the vulnerability of AdaDetect on\nsynthetic and real-world datasets. Our results show that adversarial\nperturbations can significantly increase the FDR while maintaining high\ndetection power, exposing fundamental limitations of current error-controlled\nnovelty detection methods and motivating the development of more robust\nalternatives."}

We exploit the intrinsic geometry of\nrank-one tensors by casting the recovery task as an optimization problem over\nthe Segre manifold, the smooth Riemannian manifold of rank-one tensors. This\ngeometric viewpoint yields two powerful algorithms: Riemannian Gradient Descent\n(RGD) and Riemannian Gauss-Newton (RGN), each of which preserves feasibility at\nevery iteration. Under mild noise assumptions, we prove that RGD converges at a\nlocal linear rate, while RGN exhibits an initial local quadratic convergence\nphase that transitions to a linear rate as the iterates approach the\nstatistical noise floor. Extensive synthetic experiments validate these\nconvergence guarantees and demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our\nmethods."}
