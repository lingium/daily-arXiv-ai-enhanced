Traditional\nheuristics in these settings are simple and interpretable but typically\ntailored to specific operating regimes, which can lead to inefficiencies when\nconditions change. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that\nlearns to orchestrate a set of such expert policies, leveraging their\ncomplementary strengths in a data-driven, adaptive manner. Building on the Adv2\nframework (Jonckheere et al., 2024), our method combines expert decisions\nthrough advantage-based weight updates and extends naturally to settings where\nonly estimated value functions are available. We establish both expectation and\nhigh-probability regret guarantees and derive a novel finite-time bias bound\nfor temporal-difference learning, enabling reliable advantage estimation even\nunder constant step size and non-stationary dynamics. To support scalability,\nwe introduce a neural actor-critic architecture that generalizes across large\nstate spaces while preserving interpretability.

This study investigates the central paradox of the\nsuccess of this student-led civilian uprising: how state violence, intended to\nquell dissent, ultimately fueled the movement's victory. We employ a\nmixed-methods approach. First, we develop a qualitative narrative of the\nconflict's timeline to generate specific, testable hypotheses. Then, using a\ndisaggregated, event-level dataset, we employ a multi-method quantitative\nanalysis to dissect the complex relationship between repression and\nmobilisation. We provide a framework to analyse explosive modern uprisings like\nthe July Revolution. Initial pooled regression models highlight the crucial\nrole of protest momentum in sustaining the movement. To isolate causal effects,\nwe specify a Two-Way Fixed Effects panel model, which provides robust evidence\nfor a direct and statistically significant local suppression backfire effect.\nOur Vector Autoregression (VAR) analysis provides clear visual evidence of an\nimmediate, nationwide mobilisation in response to increased lethal violence. We\nfurther demonstrate that this effect was non-linear. A structural break\nanalysis reveals that the backfire dynamic was statistically insignificant in\nthe conflict's early phase but was triggered by the catalytic moral shock of\nthe first wave of lethal violence, and its visuals circulated around July 16th.\nA complementary machine learning analysis (XGBoost, out-of-sample R$^{2}$=0.65)\ncorroborates this from a predictive standpoint, identifying \"excessive force\nagainst protesters\" as the single most dominant predictor of nationwide\nescalation. We conclude that the July Revolution was driven by a contingent,\nnon-linear backfire, triggered by specific catalytic moral shocks and\naccelerated by the viral reaction to the visual spectacle of state brutality."}

This phenomenon\nundermines the reliability of the collected demand data and hampers downstream\napplications such as demand forecasting, fleet management, and micro-mobility\nplanning. How to accurately estimate the real demand is challenging and has not\nbeen well explored in existing studies. In view of this, we contribute to real\ndemand estimation for shared micro-mobility services by proposing an analytical\nmethod that rigorously derives the real demand under appropriate assumptions.\nRather than directly modeling the intractable relationship between observed\ndemand and real demand, we propose a novel random variable, Generalized Vehicle\nSurvival Time (GVST), which is observable from trip records. The relationship\nbetween GVST and real demand is characterized by introducing a flipped queueing\nmodel (FQM) that captures the operational dynamics of shared micro-mobility\nservices. Specifically, the distribution of GVST is derived within the FQM,\nwhich allows the real demand estimation problem to be transformed into an\ninverse queueing problem. We analytically derive the real demand in closed form\nusing a one-sided estimation method, and solve the problem by a system of\nequations in a two-sided estimation method. We validate the proposed methods\nusing synthetic data and conduct empirical analyses using real-world datasets\nfrom bike-sharing and shared e-scooter systems.

This paper presents an effective methodology for\nsplit conformal prediction with unsupervised calibration for classification\ntasks. In the proposed approach, set-prediction rules are obtained using\nunsupervised calibration samples together with supervised training samples\npreviously used to learn the classification rule. Theoretical and experimental\nresults show that the presented methods can achieve performance comparable to\nthat with supervised calibration, at the expenses of a moderate degradation in\nperformance guarantees and computational efficiency."}

Yet, statistical analyses often assume that participants were\nrandomly sampled from a larger population. Under Complete Randomization,\nRandomization-Based Inference (RBI; a finite population inference) and Analysis\nof Variance (ANOVA; a random sampling inference) provide asymptotically\nequivalent difference-in-means tests. However, sequentially-enrolling trials\ntypically employ restricted randomization schemes, such as block or Maximum\nTolerable Imbalance (MTI) designs, to reduce the chance of chronological\ntreatment imbalances. The impact of these restrictions on RBI and ANOVA\nconcordance is not well understood. With real-world frames of reference, such\nas rare and ultra-rare diseases, we review full versus random sampling of\nfinite populations and empirically evaluate finite population Type I error when\nusing ANOVA following randomization restrictions. Randomization restrictions\nstrongly impacted ANOVA Type I error, even for trials with 1,000 participants.\nProperly adjusting for restrictions corrected Type I error. We corrected for\nblock randomization, yet leave open how to correct for MTI designs. More\ndirectly, RBI accounts for randomization restrictions while ensuring correct\nfinite population Type I error. Novel contributions are: 1) deepening the\nunderstanding and correction of RBI and ANOVA concordance under block and MTI\nrestrictions and 2) using finite populations to estimate the convergence of\nType I error to a nominal rate. We discuss the challenge of specifying an\nestimand's population and reconciling with sampled trial participants."}

This\nassumption is violated when individuals temporarily leave the sampling area and\nreturn during later capture occasions, which can result in biased or less\nprecise inferences under normal capture-recapture models. Existing temporary\nemigration models require that individuals are uniquely and correctly\nidentified. To our knowledge, no studies to date have addressed temporary\nemigration in the presence of latent individual identification, which can arise\nin many scenarios such as misidentification, data integration, and batch\nmarking. In this paper, we propose a new latent multinomial temporary\nemigration modelling framework for analysing capture-recapture data with latent\nidentification. The framework is applicable to both closed- and open-population\nproblems, accommodates data with or without individual identification, and\nflexibly incorporates different emigration processes, including the completely\nrandom and Markovian emigration. Through simulations, we demonstrate that model\nparameters can be reliably estimated in various emigration scenarios. We apply\nthe proposed framework to a real dataset on golden mantella collected using\nbatch marks under Pollock's robust design. The results show that accounting for\ntemporary emigration provides a better fit to the data compared to the previous\nmodel without temporary emigration."}
