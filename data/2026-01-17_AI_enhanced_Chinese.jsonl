This study presents an alert-based forecasting model to predict the timing and magnitude of ARI hospitalization peaks in Santiago. The approach integrates a seasonal SIR model with a historical mobile predictor, activated by a derivative-based alert system that detects early epidemic growth. Daily hospitalization data from DEIS were smoothed using a 15-day moving average and Savitzky-Golay filtering, and parameters were estimated using a penalized loss function to reduce sensitivity to noise. Retrospective evaluation and real-world implementation in major Santiago pediatric hospitals during 2023 and 2024 show that peak date can be anticipated about one month before the event and predicted with high accuracy two weeks in advance. Peak magnitude becomes informative roughly ten days before the peak and stabilizes one week prior. The model provides a practical and interpretable tool for hospital preparedness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8b66\u62a5\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b63\u8282\u6027SIR\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u79fb\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u63d0\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\u513f\u7ae5\u6025\u6027\u547c\u5438\u9053\u611f\u67d3\u4f4f\u9662\u9ad8\u5cf0\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u9662\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u5229\u513f\u7ae5\u6025\u6027\u547c\u5438\u9053\u611f\u67d3\uff08ARI\uff09\u662f\u513f\u79d1\u4f4f\u9662\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u51ac\u5b63\u9700\u6c42\u6fc0\u589e\u7ed9\u533b\u9662\u89c4\u5212\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\u3002\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\u4f4f\u9662\u9ad8\u5cf0\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u533b\u9662\u505a\u597d\u5e94\u5bf9\u51c6\u5907\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408\u5b63\u8282\u6027SIR\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5386\u53f2\u79fb\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bfc\u6570\u7684\u8b66\u62a5\u7cfb\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65e9\u671f\u75ab\u60c5\u589e\u957f\u3002\u4f7f\u752815\u5929\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\u548cSavitzky-Golay\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5e73\u6ed1\u6bcf\u65e5\u4f4f\u9662\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u60e9\u7f5a\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u56de\u987e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c2023-2024\u5e74\u5723\u5730\u4e9a\u54e5\u4e3b\u8981\u513f\u79d1\u533b\u9662\u7684\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u65bd\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u9ad8\u5cf0\u65e5\u671f\u53ef\u63d0\u524d\u7ea6\u4e00\u4e2a\u6708\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e24\u5468\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff1b\u9ad8\u5cf0\u89c4\u6a21\u7ea6\u5341\u5929\u524d\u5f00\u59cb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e00\u5468\u524d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u533b\u9662\u51c6\u5907\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8b66\u62a5\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u513f\u7ae5\u6025\u6027\u547c\u5438\u9053\u611f\u67d3\u4f4f\u9662\u9ad8\u5cf0\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u9662\u5e94\u5bf9\u51ac\u5b63\u9700\u6c42\u6fc0\u589e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6539\u5584\u533b\u7597\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u548c\u5e94\u6025\u51c6\u5907\u3002"}}

We define forecastability as a property of a time series (given a declared information set), and measure horizon-specific forecastability as the reduction in uncertainty provided by the past, using auto-mutual information (AMI) at lag h. AMI is estimated from training data using a k-nearest-neighbour estimator and evaluated against out-of-sample forecast error (sMAPE) on a filtered, balanced sample of 1,350 M4 series across six sampling frequencies. Seasonal Naive, ETS, and N-BEATS are used as probes of out-of-sample forecast performance. Training-only AMI provides a frequency-conditional diagnostic for forecast difficulty: for Hourly, Weekly, Quarterly, and Yearly series, AMI exhibits consistently negative rank correlation with sMAPE across probes. Under N-BEATS, the correlation is strongest for Hourly (p= -0.52) and Weekly (p= -0.51), with Quarterly (p= -0.42) and Yearly (p = -0.36) also substantial. Monthly is probe-dependent (Seasonal Naive p= -0.12; ETS p = -0.26; N-BEATS p = -0.24). Daily shows notably weaker AMI-sMAPE correlation under this protocol, suggesting limited ability to discriminate between series despite the presence of temporal dependence. The findings support within-frequency triage and effort allocation based on measurable signal content prior to forecasting, rather than between-frequency comparisons of difficulty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u6ede\u540eh\u7684\u81ea\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff08AMI\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7k\u8fd1\u90bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1AMI\uff0c\u5e76\u5728M4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u76841,350\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u5916\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\uff08sMAPE\uff09\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e8b\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u6295\u5165\u591a\u5c11\u5efa\u6a21\u52aa\u529b\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5c31\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e8f\u5217\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6ede\u540eh\u7684\u81ea\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff08AMI\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u57df\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7k\u8fd1\u90bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1AMI\uff0c\u5e76\u5728M4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u76841,350\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff086\u79cd\u91c7\u6837\u9891\u7387\uff09\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30AMI\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u5916\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\uff08sMAPE\uff09\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Seasonal Naive\u3001ETS\u548cN-BEATS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6837\u672c\u5916\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u63a2\u9488\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5c0f\u65f6\u3001\u5468\u3001\u5b63\u5ea6\u548c\u5e74\u5ea6\u5e8f\u5217\uff0cAMI\u4e0esMAPE\u5448\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8d1f\u79e9\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684AMI\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8bca\u65ad\u9884\u6d4b\u96be\u5ea6\u3002\u5728N-BEATS\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c0f\u65f6\u5e8f\u5217\uff08\u03c1=-0.52\uff09\u548c\u5468\u5e8f\u5217\uff08\u03c1=-0.51\uff09\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6700\u5f3a\uff0c\u5b63\u5ea6\uff08\u03c1=-0.42\uff09\u548c\u5e74\u5ea6\uff08\u03c1=-0.36\uff09\u4e5f\u663e\u8457\u3002\u6708\u5ea6\u5e8f\u5217\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u63a2\u9488\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e5\u5e8f\u5217\u7684AMI-sMAPE\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u5185\u5bb9\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u9891\u7387\u5185\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u52aa\u529b\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u8fdb\u884c\u9891\u7387\u95f4\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684AMI\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9891\u7387\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u96be\u5ea6\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u9884\u6d4b\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3002"}}

Our study aims to determine the underlying factors shaping mental health trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Methods: Data from the Understanding Society COVID-19 Study were utilized and the core analysis focussed on GHQ36 scores as the outcome variable. We used GAMs to evaluate trends over time and the role of sociodemographic variables, i.e., age, sex, ethnicity, country of residence (in UK), job status (employment), household income, living with a partner, living with children under age 16, and living with a long-term illness, on the variation of mental health during the study period. Results: Statistically significant differences in mental health were observed for age, sex,ethnicity, country of residence (in UK), job status (employment), household income, living with a partner, living with children under age 16, and living with a long-term illness. Women experienced higher GHQ36 scores relative to men with the GHQ36 score expected to increase by 1.260 (95%CI: 1.176, 1.345). Individuals living without a partner were expected to have higher GHQ36 scores, of 1.050 (95%CI: 0.949, 1.148) more than those living with a partner, and age groups 16-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64 experienced higher GHQ36 scores relative to those who were 65+. Individuals with relatively lower household income were likely to have poorer mental health relative to those who were more well off. Conclusion: This study identifies key demographic determinants shaping mental health trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Policies aiming to reduce mental health inequalities should target women, youth, individuals living without a partner, individuals living with children under 16, individuals with a long-term illness, and lower income families.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u82f1\u56fd\u7406\u89e3\u793e\u4f1aCOVID-19\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u4e49\u52a0\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u75ab\u60c5\u671f\u95f4\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u4eba\u53e3\u5b66\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "COVID-19\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u5bf9\u4eba\u7fa4\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u798f\u7949\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e86\u89e3\u75ab\u60c5\u671f\u95f4\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7406\u89e3\u793e\u4f1aCOVID-19\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5GHQ36\u8bc4\u5206\u4e3a\u7ed3\u679c\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5e7f\u4e49\u52a0\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u95f4\u8d8b\u52bf\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u4eba\u53e3\u5b66\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6027\u522b\u3001\u79cd\u65cf\u3001\u5c45\u4f4f\u56fd\u5bb6\u3001\u5c31\u4e1a\u72b6\u51b5\u3001\u5bb6\u5ead\u6536\u5165\u3001\u4f34\u4fa3\u72b6\u51b5\u3001\u6709\u65e016\u5c81\u4ee5\u4e0b\u5b50\u5973\u3001\u957f\u671f\u75be\u75c5\uff09\u5bf9\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5728\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6027\u522b\u3001\u79cd\u65cf\u3001\u5c45\u4f4f\u56fd\u5bb6\u3001\u5c31\u4e1a\u72b6\u51b5\u3001\u5bb6\u5ead\u6536\u5165\u3001\u4f34\u4fa3\u72b6\u51b5\u3001\u6709\u65e016\u5c81\u4ee5\u4e0b\u5b50\u5973\u3001\u957f\u671f\u75be\u75c5\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u5973\u6027GHQ36\u8bc4\u5206\u6bd4\u7537\u6027\u9ad81.260\u5206\uff1b\u65e0\u4f34\u4fa3\u8005\u6bd4\u6709\u4f34\u4fa3\u8005\u9ad81.050\u5206\uff1b16-64\u5c81\u5404\u5e74\u9f84\u6bb5\u6bd465\u5c81\u4ee5\u4e0a\u8005\u8bc4\u5206\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1b\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u5bb6\u5ead\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u51b5\u66f4\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u82f1\u56fdCOVID-19\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u671f\u95f4\u5f71\u54cd\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4eba\u53e3\u5b66\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u51cf\u5c11\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u5e94\u9488\u5bf9\u5973\u6027\u3001\u5e74\u8f7b\u4eba\u3001\u65e0\u4f34\u4fa3\u8005\u3001\u670916\u5c81\u4ee5\u4e0b\u5b50\u5973\u8005\u3001\u957f\u671f\u75be\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u548c\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u5bb6\u5ead\u3002"}}

However, for high-quality whole mitochondrial DNA genome sequences (mitogenomes), population data remain limited. In this paper, we offer a new method, MitoFREQ, for estimating the population frequencies of mitogenomes. MitoFREQ uses the mitogenome resources HelixMTdb and gnomAD, harbouring information from 195,983 and 56,406 mitogenomes, respectively. Neither HelixMTdb nor gnomAD can be queried directly for individual mitogenome frequencies, but offers single nucleotide variant (SNV) allele frequencies for each of 30 \"top-level\" haplogroups (TLHG). We propose using the HelixMTdb and gnomAD resources by classifying a given mitogenome within the TLHG scheme and subsequently using the frequency of its rarest SNV within that TLHG weighted by the TLHG frequency. We show that this method is guaranteed to provide a higher population frequency estimate than if a refined haplogroup and its SNV frequencies were used. Further, we show that top-level haplogrouping can be achieved by using only 227 specific positions for 99.9% of the tested mitogenomes, potentially making the method available for low-quality samples. The method was tested on two types of datasets: high-quality forensic reference datasets and a diverse collection of scrutinised mitogenomes from GenBank. This dual evaluation demonstrated that the approach is robust across both curated forensic data and broader population-level sequences. This method produced likelihood ratios in the range of 100-100,000, demonstrating its potential to strengthen the statistical evaluation of forensic mtDNA evidence. We have developed an open-source R package `mitofreq` that implements our method, including a Shiny app where custom TLHG frequencies can be supplied.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86MitoFREQ\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528HelixMTdb\u548cgnomAD\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4f30\u7b97\u7ebf\u7c92\u4f53\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9876\u7ea7\u5355\u500d\u7fa4\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u7a00\u6709SNV\u9891\u7387\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u4e3a\u6cd5\u533bDNA\u8bc1\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bc4\u4f30", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5168\u7ebf\u7c92\u4f53DNA\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5e8f\u5217\uff08mitogenomes\uff09\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f30\u7b97mitogenomes\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6cd5\u533bmtDNA\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMitoFREQ\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u5c06\u7ed9\u5b9amitogenome\u5206\u7c7b\u523030\u4e2a\"\u9876\u7ea7\u5355\u500d\u7fa4\"\uff08TLHG\uff09\u4e2d\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u8be5TLHG\u4e2d\u6700\u7a00\u6709\u5355\u6838\u82f7\u9178\u53d8\u5f02\uff08SNV\uff09\u7684\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u6743TLHG\u9891\u7387\uff1b3) \u4ec5\u9700227\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5373\u53ef\u5b8c\u6210\u9876\u7ea7\u5355\u500d\u7fa4\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6837\u672c", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6cd5\u533b\u53c2\u8003\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cGenBank\u591a\u6837\u5316mitogenomes\u96c6\u5408\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u90fd\u7a33\u5065\u3002\u4ea7\u751f\u4f3c\u7136\u6bd4\u5728100-100,000\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u6cd5\u533bmtDNA\u8bc1\u636e\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "MitoFREQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4f30\u7b97mitogenomes\u7fa4\u4f53\u9891\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90R\u5305`mitofreq`\uff08\u542bShiny\u5e94\u7528\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u52a0\u5f3a\u6cd5\u533bmtDNA\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bc4\u4f30"}}

To accelerate the particles, we consider a second-order score-based ODE, similar to Nesterov acceleration. In contrast to traditional kernel density score estimation, we use the recently proposed regularized Wasserstein proximal method, yielding the Accelerated Regularized Wasserstein Proximal method (ARWP). We provide a detailed analysis of continuous- and discrete-time non-asymptotic and asymptotic mixing rates for Gaussian initial and target distributions, using techniques from Euclidean acceleration and accelerated information gradients. Compared with the kinetic Langevin sampling algorithm, the proposed algorithm exhibits a higher contraction rate in the asymptotic time regime. Numerical experiments are conducted across various low-dimensional experiments, including multi-modal Gaussian mixtures and ill-conditioned Rosenbrock distributions. ARWP exhibits structured and convergent particles, accelerated discrete-time mixing, and faster tail exploration than the non-accelerated regularized Wasserstein proximal method and kinetic Langevin methods.

We demonstrate that while Sobolev regularization is the fastest method in our implementation, it produces slightly less faithful denoised meshes than the best results obtained with iterative filtering or heat diffusion.

This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of GLM estimators when the parameter dimension $d$ grows with the sample size $n$. In the first part, we establish Gaussian approximation results for the distribution of a properly centered and scaled GLM estimator uniformly over class of convex sets and Euclidean balls. Using high-dimensional results from Fang and Koike (2024) for the leading Bahadur term, bounding remainder terms as in He and Shao (2000), and applying Nazarov's (2003) Gaussian isoperimetric inequality, we show that Gaussian approximation holds when $d = o(n^{2/5})$ for convex sets and $d = o(n^{1/2})$ for Euclidean balls-the best possible rates matching those for high-dimensional sample means. We further extend these results to the bootstrap approximation when the covariance matrix is unknown. In the second part, when $d>>n$, a natural question is to answer whether all covariates are equally important. To answer that, we employ sparsity in GLM through the Lasso estimator. While Lasso is widely used for variable selection, it cannot achieve both Variable Selection Consistency (VSC) and $n^{1/2}$-consistency simultaneously (Lahiri, 2021). Under the regime ensuring VSC, we show that Gaussian approximation for the Lasso estimator fails. To overcome this, we propose a Perturbation Bootstrap (PB) approach and establish a Berry-Esseen type bound for its approximation uniformly over class of convex sets.

Unprecedented volumes of consumption data from a continuing global deployment of smart meters enable consumer segmentation based on real usage behaviours, promising to inform the design of more effective DSM and DR programs. However, existing clustering-based segmentation methods insufficiently reflect the behavioural diversity of consumers, often relying on rigid temporal alignment, and faltering in the presence of anomalies, missing data, or large-scale deployments.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage clustering framework -- Clustered Representations Optimising Consumer Segmentation (CROCS). In the first stage, each consumer's daily load profiles are clustered independently to form a Representative Load Set (RLS), providing a compact summary of their typical diurnal consumption behaviours. In the second stage, consumers are clustered using the Weighted Sum of Minimum Distances (WSMD), a novel set-to-set measure that compares RLSs by accounting for both the prevalence and similarity of those behaviours. Finally, community detection on the WSMD-induced graph reveals higher-order prototypes that embody the shared diurnal behaviours defining consumer groups, enhancing the interpretability of the resulting clusters.\n  Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real Australian smart meter datasets demonstrate that CROCS captures intra-consumer variability, uncovers both synchronous and asynchronous behavioural similarities, and remains robust to anomalies and missing data, while scaling efficiently through natural parallelisation.

While conventional frequentist approach provides a foundational basis for analysis, it often lacks the flexibility to integrate prior knowledge, which can constrain its effectiveness in adaptive settings. In contrast, Bayesian methods enable continual refinement of statistical inferences through the assimilation of accumulating evidence, thereby supporting more informed decision-making and improving the reliability of trial findings. This paper also considers persistent challenges in clinical investigations, including replication difficulties and the misinterpretation of statistical results, suggesting that Bayesian strategies may offer a path toward enhanced analytical robustness. Moreover, discrete probability models, specifically the Binomial, Poisson, and Negative Binomial distributions are explored for their suitability in modeling clinical endpoints, particularly in trials involving binary responses or data with overdispersion. The discussion further incorporates Bayesian networks and Bayesian estimation techniques, with a comparative evaluation against maximum likelihood estimation to elucidate differences in inferential behavior and practical implementation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u9891\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6574\u5408\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e8c\u9879\u3001\u6cca\u677e\u3001\u8d1f\u4e8c\u9879\u5206\u5e03\u7b49\u79bb\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ec8\u70b9\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9891\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6574\u5408\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u8bd5\u9a8c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u4e34\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\u9762\u4e34\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u56f0\u96be\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u679c\u8bef\u89e3\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e8c\u9879\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u6cca\u677e\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u8d1f\u4e8c\u9879\u5206\u5e03\u7b49\u79bb\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ec8\u70b9\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f30\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u79ef\u7d2f\u8bc1\u636e\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u660e\u667a\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e8c\u5143\u54cd\u5e94\u6216\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5206\u6563\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7b56\u7565\u4e3a\u589e\u5f3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5206\u6790\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6574\u5408\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u5f0f\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

These measures are intended to have the property of 0 expectation under a null distribution and maximum value 1 under maximal similarity to aid in interpretation. Measures are frequently adjusted with respect to the permutation distribution for historic and analytic reasons. There is currently renewed interest in considering other null models more appropriate for context, such as clustering ensembles permitting a random number of identified clusters. The purpose of this work is two -- fold: (1) to generalize the study of the adjustment operator to general null models and to a more general procedure which includes statistical standardization as a special case and (2) to identify sufficient conditions for the adjustment operator to produce the intended properties, where sufficient conditions are related to whether and how observed data are incorporated into null distributions.

While theoretically appealing, the NDD is underused in practice due to two main limitations: the need to predefine the tree structure and the lack of diagnostics for evaluating model fit. This paper addresses both issues. First, we introduce a data-driven, greedy tree-finding algorithm that identifies plausible NDD tree structures from observed data. Second, we propose novel diagnostic tools, including pseudo-residuals based on a saddlepoint approximation to the marginal distributions and a likelihood displacement measure to detect influential observations. These tools provide accurate and computationally tractable assessments of model fit, even when marginal distributions are analytically intractable. We demonstrate our approach through simulation studies and apply it to data from a Morris water maze experiment, where the goal is to detect differences in spatial learning strategies among cognitively impaired and unimpaired mice. Our methods yield interpretable structures and improved model evaluation in a realistic compositional setting. An accompanying R package is provided to support reproducibility and application to new datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5d4c\u5957\u72c4\u5229\u514b\u96f7\u5206\u5e03(NDD)\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u5927\u9650\u5236\u2014\u2014\u9700\u8981\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u2014\u2014\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8d2a\u5a6a\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u978d\u70b9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u4f2a\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "NDD\u867d\u7136\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u72c4\u5229\u514b\u96f7\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u653e\u5bbd\u6210\u5206\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8d2a\u5a6a\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u5408\u7406\u7684NDD\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b2. \u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u978d\u70b9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u4f2a\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u4f3c\u7136\u4f4d\u79fb\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u5206\u5e03\u89e3\u6790\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u65f6\u4e5f\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u548cMorris\u6c34\u8ff7\u5bab\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u6210\u5206\u6570\u636e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u68c0\u6d4b\u8ba4\u77e5\u53d7\u635f\u548c\u672a\u53d7\u635f\u5c0f\u9f20\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86NDD\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f7fNDD\u66f4\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u6210\u5206\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u3002\u914d\u5957R\u5305\u652f\u6301\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Our propositions remarkably well concur with recent literature: (i) in [20] local entropy replica approach predicts $\u03b1_{LE}\\approx 1.58$ as the onset of clustering defragmentation (presumed driving force behind locally improving algorithms failures); (ii) in $\u03b1\\rightarrow 0$ regime we obtain on the third lifting level $\u03ba\\approx 1.2385\\sqrt{\\frac{\u03b1_a}{-\\log\\left ( \u03b1_a \\right ) }}$ which qualitatively matches overlap gap property (OGP) based predictions of [43] and identically matches local entropy based predictions of [24]; (iii) $c$-sequence ordering change phenomenology mirrors the one observed in asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) in [98] and the negative Hopfield model in [100]; and (iv) as in [98,100], we here design a CLuP based algorithm whose practical performance closely matches proposed theoretical predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u5168\u63d0\u5347\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u5076\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e8c\u5143\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1-\u8ba1\u7b97\u95f4\u9699\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8c\u9636\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u5e94\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u9ad8\u9636\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u5e94\u7b97\u6cd5\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7ea60.2\u7684\u95f4\u9699\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e8c\u5143\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1-\u8ba1\u7b97\u95f4\u9699\uff0c\u5373\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u9608\u503c\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9608\u503c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b8c\u5168\u63d0\u5347\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u5076\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790c\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u5347\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0a\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u9608\u503c\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u9608\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e8c\u5143\u611f\u77e5\u673a\uff0c\u4e8c\u9636\u63d0\u5347\u5f97\u5230\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u9608\u503c\u03b1_c\u22481.8159\uff0c\u4e03\u9636\u63d0\u5347\u5f97\u5230\u7b97\u6cd5\u9608\u503c\u03b1_a\u22481.6021\uff08\u8d8b\u5411\u4e8e\u7ea61.59\uff09\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7ea60.2\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u95f4\u9699\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e8c\u5143\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1-\u8ba1\u7b97\u95f4\u9699\uff0cfl-RDT\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u71b5\u3001\u91cd\u53e0\u95f4\u9699\u6027\u8d28\u7b49\u6587\u732e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

Conventional one-stage conditional models and instrument-based two-stage estimators are prone to bias under endogeneity, and sufficiently strong instruments are often unavailable in practice. To address these challenges, we propose a semiparametric recursive copula framework that jointly specifies marginal models for both LVI, treated as an endogenous exposure, and a binary 2-year survival outcome, and links them through a flexible copula to account for latent confounding and accommodate censoring without requiring strong instruments. In two simulation studies, we systematically varied sample sizes, censoring rates from 0% to 60%, and endogeneity strengths, and assessed robustness under moderate model misspecification. The proposed copula framework exhibited reduced bias and improved interval coverage compared with both one-stage and two-stage approaches while maintaining robustness to moderate misspecification. We applied the method to HNSC cases with associated clinical and microRNA data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (n = 215), and found that LVI significantly reduced 2-year survival probability by approximately 47%, with a 95% confidence interval of -0.61 to -0.29 on the probability scale. The estimated positive dependence parameter indicates that the attenuation is driven by residual dependence between unobserved components of LVI and survival. Overall, the proposed copula framework yields more credible effect estimates for survival outcomes in the absence of strong instruments, mitigating biases due to endogeneity and censoring and strengthening quantitative evidence for HNSC research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u534a\u53c2\u6570\u9012\u5f52copula\u6846\u67b6\u5904\u7406\u5934\u9888\u9cde\u764c\u4e2d\u6dcb\u5df4\u8840\u7ba1\u4fb5\u72af(LVI)\u7684\u5185\u751f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5f3a\u5de5\u5177\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "LVI\u662f\u5934\u9888\u9cde\u764c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u9884\u540e\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u751f\u5b58\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u672a\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5185\u751f\u6027\u800c\u626d\u66f2\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u6761\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5de5\u5177\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u5185\u751f\u6027\u4e0b\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u504f\u501a\uff0c\u4e14\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u5f3a\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u534a\u53c2\u6570\u9012\u5f52copula\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u6307\u5b9aLVI\uff08\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5185\u751f\u66b4\u9732\u53d8\u91cf\uff09\u548c\u4e8c\u51432\u5e74\u751f\u5b58\u7ed3\u5c40\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7075\u6d3bcopula\u8fde\u63a5\u4e24\u8005\u4ee5\u8003\u8651\u6f5c\u5728\u6df7\u6742\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u5220\u5931\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5f3a\u5de5\u5177\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5copula\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u504f\u501a\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u533a\u95f4\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e2d\u7b49\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u8bbe\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eTCGA\u6570\u636e\uff08n=215\uff09\u53d1\u73b0LVI\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e2\u5e74\u751f\u5b58\u6982\u7387\u7ea647%\uff0895% CI: -0.61\u81f3-0.29\uff09\uff0c\u6b63\u4f9d\u8d56\u53c2\u6570\u8868\u660e\u8870\u51cf\u7531LVI\u548c\u751f\u5b58\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u6210\u5206\u95f4\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u4f9d\u8d56\u9a71\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684copula\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5f3a\u5de5\u5177\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e3a\u751f\u5b58\u7ed3\u5c40\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u5185\u751f\u6027\u548c\u5220\u5931\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u504f\u501a\uff0c\u52a0\u5f3a\u4e86\u5934\u9888\u9cde\u764c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc1\u636e\u3002"}}

Within this framework, we study a family of oversampling procedures that augment the training data by generating synthetic samples from an estimated minority-class distribution to roughly balance the classes, among which the celebrated SMOTE algorithm is a canonical example. We show that the excess risk decomposes into the rate achievable under balanced training (as if the data had been drawn from the balanced target distribution) and an additional term, the cost of transfer, which quantifies the discrepancy between the estimated and true minority-class distributions. In particular, we show that the cost of transfer for SMOTE dominates that of bootstrapping (random oversampling) in moderately high dimensions, suggesting that we should expect bootstrapping to have better performance than SMOTE in general.

The weighted least squares estimation with univariate-dependent weights has limitations in constructing weight functions. Therefore, this paper proposes a multivariate dependent weighted least squares estimation method. By constructing a linear combination of explanatory variables and maximizing their Spearman rank correlation coefficient with the absolute residual value, combined with maximum likelihood method to depict heteroscedasticity, it can comprehensively reflect the trend of variance changes in the random error and improve the accuracy of the model. This paper demonstrates that the optimal linear combination exponent estimator for heteroscedastic volatility obtained by our algorithm possesses consistency and asymptotic normality. In the simulation experiment, three scenarios of heteroscedasticity were designed, and the comparison showed that the proposed method was superior to the univariate-dependent weighting method in parameter estimation and model prediction. In the real data applications, the proposed method was applied to two real-world datasets about consumer spending in China and housing prices in Boston.

Unlike many existing approaches that are limited to specific loss functions or rely on challenging non-convex optimization, our framework is applicable to a broad spectrum of regression tasks. Examples include linear regression with squared loss, binary classification with cross-entropy loss, quantile regression with pinball loss, and robust regression with Huber loss. We derive a novel characterization of the fair risk minimizer, which yields a computationally efficient estimation procedure for general loss functions. Theoretically, we establish the asymptotic consistency of the proposed estimator and derive its convergence rates under mild assumptions. We illustrate the method's versatility through detailed discussions of several common loss functions.

To mitigate the inherent discreteness and boundary irregularities of the empirical tail copula, a checkerboard smoothed tail copula estimator based on local bilinear interpolation is introduced. Almost sure uniform consistency and weak convergence of the centered and scaled empirical checkerboard tail copula process are established in the space of bounded functions. The resulting Gaussian limit differs from its known-marginal counterpart and incorporates additional correction terms that account for first-order stochastic errors arising from marginal estimation. Since the limiting covariance structure depends on the unknown tail copula and its partial derivatives, direct asymptotic inference is generally infeasible. To address this challenge, a direct multiplier bootstrap procedure tailored to the checkerboard tail copula is developed. By combining multiplier reweighting with checkerboard smoothing, the bootstrap preserves the extremal dependence structure of the data and consistently captures both joint tail variability and the effects of marginal estimation. Conditional weak convergence of the bootstrap process to the same Gaussian limit as the original estimator is established, yielding asymptotically valid inference for smooth functionals of the tail copula, including the lower and upper tail dependence coefficient. The proposed approach provides a fully feasible framework for confidence regions and hypothesis testing in tail dependence analysis without requiring explicit estimation of the limiting covariance structure. A simulation study illustrates the finite-sample performance of the proposed estimator and demonstrates the accuracy and reliability of the bootstrap confidence intervals under various dependence structures and tuning parameter choices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u68cb\u76d8\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u5c3e\u90e8\u8fde\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u672a\u77e5\u8fb9\u9645\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u5c3e\u90e8\u4f9d\u8d56\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u76f4\u63a5\u4e58\u6570\u81ea\u52a9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u884c\u63a8\u65ad", "motivation": "\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u8fb9\u9645\u5206\u5e03\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5c3e\u90e8\u8fde\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\u5b58\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u6027\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u53cc\u7ebf\u6027\u63d2\u503c\u7684\u68cb\u76d8\u5e73\u6ed1\u5c3e\u90e8\u8fde\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5176\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5f31\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u76f4\u63a5\u4e58\u6570\u81ea\u52a9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u65ad", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7ecf\u9a8c\u68cb\u76d8\u5c3e\u90e8\u8fde\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5f31\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u81ea\u52a9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6761\u4ef6\u5f31\u6536\u655b\u5230\u76f8\u540c\u9ad8\u65af\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5c3e\u90e8\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u65ad", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5c3e\u90e8\u4f9d\u8d56\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u57df\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u4f30\u8ba1\u6781\u9650\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd"}}

In the frequentist framework, O'Brien-Fleming-type stopping boundaries dominate practice because they impose highly conservative early stopping while allowing more liberal decisions as information accumulates. Bayesian GSDs, in contrast, are most often implemented using fixed posterior probability thresholds applied uniformly at all analyses. While such designs can be calibrated to control the overall type I error rate, they do not penalise early analyses and can therefore lead to substantially more aggressive early stopping. Such behaviour can risk premature conclusions and inflation of treatment effect estimates, raising concerns for confirmatory trials. We introduce two practically implementable refinements that restore conservative early stopping in Bayesian GSDs. The first introduces a two-phase structure for posterior probability thresholds, applying more stringent criteria in the early phase of the trial and relaxing them later to preserve power. The second replaces posterior probability monitoring at interim looks with predictive probability criteria, which naturally account for uncertainty in future data and therefore suppress premature stopping. Both strategies require only one additional tuning parameter and can be efficiently calibrated. In the HYPRESS setting, both approaches achieve higher power than the conventional Bayesian design while producing alpha-spending profiles closely aligned with O'Brien-Fleming-type behaviour at early looks. These refinements provide a principled and tractable way to align Bayesian GSDs with accepted frequentist practice and regulatory expectations, supporting their robust application in confirmatory trials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5e8f\u8d2f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u540e\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\u9608\u503c\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u65e9\u671f\u505c\u6b62\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u7b26\u5408O'Brien-Fleming\u578b\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5e8f\u8d2f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u6574\u4f53I\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u65e9\u671f\u5206\u6790\u7684\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u65e9\u505c\u6b62\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u8fc7\u65e9\u7ed3\u8bba\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u81a8\u80c0\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u786e\u8bc1\u6027\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1) \u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u540e\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\u9608\u503c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u8bd5\u9a8c\u65e9\u671f\u5e94\u7528\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u653e\u5bbd\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u529f\u6548\uff1b2) \u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u6807\u51c6\u66ff\u4ee3\u540e\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u8003\u8651\u672a\u6765\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6291\u5236\u8fc7\u65e9\u505c\u6b62\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u90fd\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8c03\u4f18\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728HYPRESS\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bbe\u8ba1\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u529f\u6548\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u03b1\u6d88\u8017\u66f2\u7ebf\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u4e0eO'Brien-Fleming\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7d27\u5bc6\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6539\u8fdb\u4e3a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5e8f\u8d2f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u4e0e\u516c\u8ba4\u7684\u9891\u7387\u5b66\u6d3e\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u671f\u671b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5176\u5728\u786e\u8bc1\u6027\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}
