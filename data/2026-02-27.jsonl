(2023) we propose an algorithm that uses an adaptive bounded balancing function. We argue why implementing parallel tempering where each replica uses a rejection free MCMC algorithm can be inefficient in high dimensional spaces and show how the proposed adaptive algorithm can overcome these computational inefficiencies. We present two equivalent versions of the adaptive algorithm (A-IIT and SS-IIT) and establish that both have the same limiting distribution, making either suitable for use within a parallel tempering framework. To evaluate performance, we benchmark the adaptive algorithm against several MCMC methods: IIT, Rejection free Metropolis-Hastings (RF-MH) and RF-MH using a multiplicity list. Simulation results demonstrate that Adaptive IIT identifies high-probability states more efficiently than these competing algorithms in high-dimensional binary spaces with multiple modes."}

In the present article, I consider p-hacking in the context of two philosophies of significance testing - the error statistical approach and the formal inference approach. I argue that although p-hacking inflates Type I error rates in the error statistical approach, it does not inflate them in the formal inference approach. Specifically, in the error statistical approach, the \"actual\" familywise error rate (e.g., 1 - [1 - 0.05]2 = 0.098 for two tests) is relevant because it covers both the selectively reported and unreported tests in the \"actual\" test procedure (i.e., p1;H0,1 and p2;H0,2). In this approach, Type I error rate inflation occurs because the \"actual\" error rate (0.098) is higher than the nominal error rate (0.05). In contrast, in the formal inference approach, the \"actual\" familywise error rate is irrelevant because (a) the researcher does not report a statistical inference about the corresponding intersection null hypothesis (i.e., H0,1 intersect H0,2), and (b) the \"actual\" familywise error rate does not license inferences about the reported individual hypotheses (i.e., H0,2). Instead, in the formal inference approach, only the nominal error rate is relevant, and a comparison with the \"actual\" error rate is inappropriate. Implications for conceptualizing, demonstrating, and reducing p-hacking are discussed."}

This is accomplished typically by granting accelerated approval based on a surrogate endpoint that can be measured earlier than a traditional approval endpoint. Minimal residual disease (MRD) is a sensitive measure of residual cancer cells in hematology oncology after treatment, and is increasingly considered as a secondary or exploratory endpoint due to its prognostic potential for traditional clinical trial endpoints such as progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). This work aims to evaluate MRD's surrogacy potential across several hematologic cancer indications while keeping the focus on follicular lymphoma (FL), using data from published studies. We examine individual-level and trial-level correlations extracted from previously published studies to elucidate the potential role of MRD in accelerating the drug approval process in hematology oncology trials."}

Even more patients could be helped with a transplant if the rate of kidneys that are discarded and not transplanted could be reduced. Machine learning (ML) can support decision-making in this context by early identification of donor organs at high risk of discard, for instance to enable timely interventions to improve organ utilization such as rescue allocation. Although various ML models have been applied, their results are difficult to compare due to heterogenous datasets and differences in feature engineering and evaluation strategies. This study aims to provide a systematic and reproducible comparison of ML models for donor kidney discard prediction. We trained five commonly used ML models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Deep Learning along with an ensemble model on data from 4,080 deceased donors (death determined by neurologic criteria) in Germany. A unified benchmarking framework was implemented, including standardized feature engineering and selection, and Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. Model performance was assessed for discrimination (MCC, AUC, F1), calibration (Brier score), and explainability (SHAP). The ensemble achieved the highest discrimination performance (MCC=0.76, AUC=0.87, F1=0.90), while individual models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Deep Learning performed comparably and better than Decision Trees. Platt scaling improved calibration for tree-and neural network-based models. SHAP consistently identified donor age and renal markers as dominant predictors across models, reflecting clinical plausibility. This study demonstrates that consistent data preprocessing, feature selection, and evaluation can be more decisive for predictive success than the choice of the ML algorithm."}

An increasingly common HED involves the integration of the sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) with the micro-randomized trial (MRT), allowing investigators to answer scientific questions about potential synergistic effects of digital and human-delivered interventions. Approaches to formalize these questions in terms of causal estimands and associated data analytic methods are limited.

When the quantity of interest varies significantly under the posterior, accurate estimates demand many samples -- a cost often prohibitive for partial differential equation-constrained problems. To address this challenge, we introduce conditional neural control variates, a modular method that learns amortized control variates from joint model-data samples to reduce the variance of MC estimators. To scale to high-dimensional problems, we leverage Stein's identity to design an architecture based on an ensemble of hierarchical coupling layers with tractable Jacobian trace computation. Training requires: (i) samples from the joint distribution of unknown parameters and observed data; and (ii) the posterior score function, which can be computed from physics-based likelihood evaluations, neural operator surrogates, or learned generative models such as conditional normalizing flows. Once trained, the control variates generalize across observations without retraining. We validate our approach on stylized and partial differential equation-constrained Darcy flow inverse problems, demonstrating substantial variance reduction, even when the analytical score is replaced by a learned surrogate."}

The presentation is modular: we state broadly applicable guarantees under high-level conditions and give tools for verifying them for specific losses and function classes. We emphasize that many ERM rate derivations can be organized around a three-step recipe -- a basic inequality, a uniform local concentration bound, and a fixed-point argument -- which yields regret bounds in terms of a critical radius, defined via localized Rademacher complexity, under a mild Bernstein-type variance--risk condition. To make these bounds concrete, we upper bound the critical radius using local maximal inequalities and metric-entropy integrals, recovering familiar rates for VC-subgraph, Sobolev/Hölder, and bounded-variation classes.\n  We also review ERM with nuisance components -- including weighted ERM and Neyman-orthogonal losses -- as they arise in causal inference, missing data, and domain adaptation. Following the orthogonal learning framework, we highlight that these problems often admit regret-transfer bounds linking regret under an estimated loss to population regret under the target loss. These bounds typically decompose regret into (i) statistical error under the estimated (optimized) loss and (ii) approximation error due to nuisance estimation. Under sample splitting or cross-fitting, the first term can be controlled using standard fixed-loss ERM regret bounds, while the second term depends only on nuisance-estimation accuracy. We also treat the in-sample regime, where nuisances and the ERM are fit on the same data, deriving regret bounds and giving sufficient conditions for fast rates."}

Various fair clustering algorithms have been proposed that modify standard K-means clustering to satisfy a given fairness constraint. A critical limitation of several existing fair clustering algorithms is that the number of parameters to be learned is proportional to the sample size because the cluster assignment of each datum should be optimized simultaneously with the cluster center, and thus scaling up the algorithms is difficult. In this paper, we propose a new fair clustering algorithm based on a finite mixture model, called Fair Model-based Clustering (FMC). A main advantage of FMC is that the number of learnable parameters is independent of the sample size and thus can be scaled up easily. In particular, mini-batch learning is possible to obtain clusters that are approximately fair. Moreover, FMC can be applied to non-metric data (e.g., categorical data) as long as the likelihood is well-defined. Theoretical and empirical justifications for the superiority of the proposed algorithm are provided."}

We developed a method to construct indicators for the degree of sample overlap in evidence synthesis of studies based on existing data. Our method is rooted in set theory and is based on the coding of the ranges of several well selected sample characteristics, offers a practical solution by focusing on making inference based on sample characteristics rather than on individual participant data.

Yet, it lacks rigorous uncertainty quantification, leading to open decision boundaries and, consequently, vulnerability to outliers, adversarial perturbations, and out-of-distribution inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce ConformalHDC, a unified framework that combines the statistical guarantees of conformal prediction with the computational efficiency of HDC. For this framework, we propose two complementary variations. First, the set-valued formulation provides finite-sample, distribution-free coverage guarantees. Using carefully designed conformity scores, it forms enclosed decision boundaries that improve robustness to non-conforming inputs. Second, the point-valued formulation leverages the same conformity scores to produce a single prediction when desired, potentially improving accuracy over traditional HDC by accounting for class interactions. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the proposed framework through evaluations on multiple real-world datasets. In particular, we apply our method to the challenging problem of decoding non-spatial stimulus information from the spiking activity of hippocampal neurons recorded as subjects performed a sequence memory task. Our results show that ConformalHDC not only accurately decodes the stimulus information represented in the neural activity data, but also provides rigorous uncertainty estimates and correctly abstains when presented with data from other behavioral states. Overall, these capabilities position the framework as a reliable, uncertainty-aware foundation for neuromorphic computing."}

The choice of representation and the associated distance determine properties of the methods in which they are used: for example, certain distances can allow one to encode robustness or smoothness of the problem. Kernel methods offer flexible and rich Hilbert space representations of distributions that allow the modeller to enforce properties through the choice of kernel, and estimate associated distances at efficient nonparametric rates. In particular, the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a kernel-based distance constructed by comparing Hilbert space mean functions, has received significant attention due to its computational tractability and is favoured by practitioners.\n  In this thesis, we conduct a thorough study of kernel-based distances with a focus on efficient computation, with core contributions in Chapters 3 to 6. Part I of the thesis is focused on the MMD, specifically on improved MMD estimation. In Chapter 3 we propose a theoretically sound, improved estimator for MMD in simulation-based inference. Then, in Chapter 4, we propose an MMD-based estimator for conditional expectations, a ubiquitous task in statistical computation. Closing Part I, in Chapter 5 we study the problem of calibration when MMD is applied to the task of integration.\n  In Part II, motivated by the recent developments in kernel embeddings beyond the mean, we introduce a family of novel kernel-based discrepancies: kernel quantile discrepancies. These address some of the pitfalls of MMD, and are shown through both theoretical results and an empirical study to offer a competitive alternative to MMD and its fast approximations.

This work studies the problem of estimating connection probabilities in multi-layer networks and introduces a new Multi-layer Iterative Connection Probability Estimation (MICE) method. The proposed approach employs an iterative framework that jointly refines inter-layer and intra-layer similarity sets by dynamically updating distance metrics derived from current probability estimates. By leveraging both layer-level and node-level neighborhood information, MICE improves estimation accuracy while preserving computational efficiency. Theoretical analysis establishes the consistency of the estimator and shows that, under mild regularity conditions, the proposed method achieves an optimal convergence rate comparable to that of an oracle estimator. Extensive simulation studies across diverse graphon structures demonstrate the superior performance of MICE relative to existing methods. Empirical evaluations using brain network data from patients with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and global food and agricultural trade network data further illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the method in link prediction tasks. Overall, this work provides a theoretically grounded and practically scalable framework for probabilistic modeling and inference in multi-layer network systems."}

The standard global test employs a Bonferroni correction and has an expected stopping time bound of $O\\left(\\ln\\frac{k}α\\right)$ when $k$ is large and the significance level of the test, $α$, is small. In this work, we construct new sequential tests by using ideas of merging test martingales with different trade-offs in expected stopping times under different, sparse or dense alternative hypotheses. We further derive a new, balanced test that achieves an improved expected stopping time bound that matches Bonferroni's in the sparse setting but that naturally results in $O\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\ln\\frac{1}α\\right)$ under a dense alternative.

The presentation is modular: we state broadly applicable guarantees under high-level conditions and give tools for verifying them for specific losses and function classes. We emphasize that many ERM rate derivations can be organized around a three-step recipe -- a basic inequality, a uniform local concentration bound, and a fixed-point argument -- which yields regret bounds in terms of a critical radius, defined via localized Rademacher complexity, under a mild Bernstein-type variance--risk condition. To make these bounds concrete, we upper bound the critical radius using local maximal inequalities and metric-entropy integrals, recovering familiar rates for VC-subgraph, Sobolev/Hölder, and bounded-variation classes.\n  We also review ERM with nuisance components -- including weighted ERM and Neyman-orthogonal losses -- as they arise in causal inference, missing data, and domain adaptation. Following the orthogonal learning framework, we highlight that these problems often admit regret-transfer bounds linking regret under an estimated loss to population regret under the target loss. These bounds typically decompose regret into (i) statistical error under the estimated (optimized) loss and (ii) approximation error due to nuisance estimation. Under sample splitting or cross-fitting, the first term can be controlled using standard fixed-loss ERM regret bounds, while the second term depends only on nuisance-estimation accuracy. We also treat the in-sample regime, where nuisances and the ERM are fit on the same data, deriving regret bounds and giving sufficient conditions for fast rates."}

It combines a robust pilot fit, doubly adaptive observation weights for residual outliers and leverage points, and folded concave penalization for fixed effect selection, together with weighted updates of random effects and variance components. We develop an iterative reweighting algorithm and establish estimation and prediction error bounds, support recovery consistency, and oracle-type asymptotic normality. Simulations show that DAR-R improves estimation accuracy, false-positive control, and covariance estimation under both vertical outliers and bad leverage contamination.

Various fair clustering algorithms have been proposed that modify standard K-means clustering to satisfy a given fairness constraint. A critical limitation of several existing fair clustering algorithms is that the number of parameters to be learned is proportional to the sample size because the cluster assignment of each datum should be optimized simultaneously with the cluster center, and thus scaling up the algorithms is difficult. In this paper, we propose a new fair clustering algorithm based on a finite mixture model, called Fair Model-based Clustering (FMC). A main advantage of FMC is that the number of learnable parameters is independent of the sample size and thus can be scaled up easily. In particular, mini-batch learning is possible to obtain clusters that are approximately fair. Moreover, FMC can be applied to non-metric data (e.g., categorical data) as long as the likelihood is well-defined. Theoretical and empirical justifications for the superiority of the proposed algorithm are provided."}

Methods such as capture-recapture are widely used, but rely on assumptions that are often violated and not feasible in specific applications. We describe a Bayesian modelling approach called Multi-Parameter Estimation of Prevalence (MPEP). The MPEP approach leverages routinely collected administrative data, starting from a large baseline cohort of individuals from the population of interest and linked events, to estimate the full size of the target population. When multiple event types are included, the approach enables checking of the consistency of evidence about prevalence from different event types. Additional evidence can be incorporated where inconsistencies are identified. In this article, we summarize the general framework of MPEP, with focus on the most recent version, with improved computational efficiency (implemented in STAN). We also explore several extensions to the model that help us understand the sensitivity of the results to modelling assumptions or identify potential sources of bias. We demonstrate the MPEP approach through a case study estimating the prevalence of opioid dependence in Scotland each year from 2014 to 2022."}

Existing theory for causal inference from adaptive experiments primarily assumes the superpopulation framework with independent and identically distributed units, and may not apply when the distribution of units evolves over time. This paper makes two contributions. First, we extend the literature to the finite-population framework, which allows for possibly nonexchangeable units, and establish the design-based theory for causal inference under general adaptive designs using inverse-propensity-weighted (IPW) and augmented IPW (AIPW) estimators. Our theory accommodates nonexchangeable units, both nonconverging and vanishing treatment probabilities, and nonconverging outcome estimators, thereby justifying inference using AIPW estimators with black-box outcome models that integrate advances from machine learning methods. To alleviate the conservativeness inherent in variance estimation under finite-population inference, we also introduce a covariance estimator for the AIPW estimator that becomes sharp when the residuals from the adaptive regression of potential outcomes on covariates are additive across units. Our framework encompasses widely used adaptive designs, such as multi-armed bandits, covariate-adaptive randomization, and sequential rerandomization, advancing the design-based theory for causal inference in these specific settings. Second, as a methodological contribution, we propose an adaptive covariate adjustment approach for analyzing even nonadaptive designs. The martingale structure induced by adaptive adjustment enables valid inference with black-box outcome estimators that would otherwise require strong assumptions under standard nonadaptive analysis."}

Standard latent-space interpolations fail to respect the structure of the learned distribution, often traversing low-density regions. We introduce a framework based on the string method that computes continuous paths between samples by evolving curves under the learned score function. Operating on pretrained models without retraining, our approach interpolates between three regimes: pure generative transport, which yields continuous sample paths; gradient-dominated dynamics, which recover minimum energy paths (MEPs); and finite-temperature string dynamics, which compute principal curves -- self-consistent paths that balance energy and entropy. We demonstrate that the choice of regime matters in practice. For image diffusion models, MEPs contain high-likelihood but unrealistic ''cartoon'' images, confirming prior observations that likelihood maxima appear unrealistic; principal curves instead yield realistic morphing sequences despite lower likelihood. For protein structure prediction, our method computes transition pathways between metastable conformers directly from models trained on static structures, yielding paths with physically plausible intermediates. Together, these results establish the string method as a principled tool for probing the modal structure of diffusion models -- identifying modes, characterizing barriers, and mapping connectivity in complex learned distributions."}

We propose a budgeted active experimentation framework that iteratively enhances model training for causal effect estimation via active sampling. By leveraging observational priors, we develop an acquisition function targeting uplift estimation uncertainty, overlap deficits, and domain discrepancy to select the most informative units for randomized experiments.
