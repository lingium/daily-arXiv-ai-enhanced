Because both assumptions are frequently invalid, estimators more aligned with real-world settings have been proposed. An effect can be estimated as the difference in areas below the cumulative incidence functions of two groups up to a pre-specified time point. This approach, restricted mean time lost (RMTL), can be used in settings with competing risks as well. We extend RMTL estimation for use in an understudied health policy application in Medicare. Medicare currently supports healthcare payment for over 69 million beneficiaries, most of whom are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans and receive insurance from private insurers. These insurers are prospectively paid by the federal government for each of their beneficiaries' anticipated health needs using an ordinary least squares linear regression algorithm. As all coefficients are positive and predictor variables are largely insurer-submitted health conditions, insurers are incentivized to upcode, or report more diagnoses than may be accurate. Such gaming is projected to cost the federal government $40 billion in 2025 alone without clear benefit to beneficiaries. We propose several novel estimators of coding intensity and possible upcoding in Medicare Advantage, including accounting for unreliable reporting. We demonstrate estimator performance in simulated data leveraging the National Institutes of Health's All of Us study and also develop an open source R package to simulate realistic labeled upcoding data, which were not previously available."}

Many existing methods detect differentially methylated regions by aggregating CpG-level test results, which may limit their ability to capture complex regional methylation patterns. In this paper, we introduce the R package mmcmcBayes, which implements a multistage Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure for region-level detection of differentially methylated regions. The method models sample-wise regional methylation summaries using the alpha-skew generalized normal distribution and evaluates evidence for differential methylation between groups through Bayes factors. We use a multistage region-splitting strategy to refine candidate regions based on statistical evidence. We describe the underlying methodology and software implementation, and illustrate its performance through simulation studies and applications to Illumina 450K methylation data. The mmcmcBayes package provides a practical region-level alternative to existing CpG-based differentially methylated regions detection methods and includes supporting functions for summarizing, comparing, and visualizing detected regions."}

This paper formulates the optimisation of the IW-ELBO in Bures-Wasserstein space, a manifold of Gaussian distributions equipped with the 2-Wasserstein metric. We derive the Wasserstein gradient of the IW-ELBO and project it onto the Bures-Wasserstein space to yield a tractable algorithm for Gaussian VI.\n  A pivotal contribution of our analysis concerns the stability of the gradient estimator. While the SNR of the standard Euclidean gradient estimator is known to vanish as the number of importance samples $K$ increases, we prove that the SNR of the Wasserstein gradient scales favourably as $Ω(\\sqrt{K})$, ensuring optimisation efficiency even for large $K$. We further extend this geometric analysis to the Variational Rényi Importance-Weighted Autoencoder bound, establishing analogous stability guarantees. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior approximation performance compared to other baselines."}

The GSB divergence unifies two important classes of statistical distances, namely the S-divergence and the Bregman exponential divergence (BED), thereby encompassing several widely used subfamilies, including the power divergence (PD), density power divergence (DPD), and S-Hellinger distance (S-HD). In parametric inference, minimum divergence estimators are well known to balance robustness with high asymptotic efficiency relative to the maximum likelihood estimator. However, nonparametric tests based on such statistical distances have been relatively less explored. In this paper, we construct a class of consistent and robust nonparametric two-sample tests for the equality of two absolutely continuous distributions using the generalized MI. We establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed test statistics under the null and contiguous alternatives. The robustness properties of the generalized MI are rigorously studied through the influence function and the breakdown point, demonstrating that stability of the generalized MI translates into stability of the associated tests. Extensive simulation studies show that divergences beyond the PD family often yield superior robustness under contamination while retaining high asymptotic power. A data-driven scheme for selecting optimal tuning parameters is also proposed. Finally, the methodology is illustrated with applications to real data."}

Our main technical contribution is a modification to the EAT method that theoretically guarantees an unbiased first moment (exactly matching the firing rate), and reduces second-moment bias. We evaluate these methods on their distributional fidelity, gradient quality, and performance on two tasks: (1) variational autoencoders with Poisson latents, and (2) partially observable generalized linear models, where latent neural connectivity must be inferred from observed spike trains. Across all metrics, our modified EAT method exhibits better overall performance (often comparable to exact gradients), and substantially higher robustness to hyperparameter choices.

Our study investigates innovation at a finer spatial resolution, going beyond proprietary or static indicators. We develop the Local Innovation Determinants (LID) database and framework to identify key enabling factors across regions, combining traditional government data with publicly available data via APIs for a more granular understanding of spatial dynamics shaping innovation capacity. Using exploratory big and geospatial data analytics and random forest models, we examine neighborhoods in New York and Massachusetts across four dimensions: social factors, economic characteristics, land use and mobility, morphology, and environment.

Our BNP approach offers several advantages, including its efficacy in handling small datasets or censored data, which are common in ecological risk assessment, and its ability to provide principled uncertainty quantification alongside simultaneous density estimation and clustering. We utilize a specific nonparametric prior as the mixing measure, chosen for its robust clustering properties, a crucial consideration given the lack of strong prior beliefs about the number of components.

By incorporating this additional information, we can provide a stronger privacy guarantee (e.g. an amplification). The range restricted formal privacy standards protect only a subset (or ball) of data values and exclude ranges (or balls) believed to be already publicly known. The privacy standards are designed for the risk-weighted pseudo posterior (model) mechanism (PPM) used to generate synthetic data under an asymptotic Differential (aDP) privacy guarantee. The PPM downweights the likelihood contribution for each record proportionally to its disclosure risk. The PPM is adapted under inclusion of beliefs by adjusting the risk-weighted pseudo likelihood. We introduce two alternative adjustments. The first expresses data owner knowledge of the sensitive range as a probability, $λ$, that a datum value drawn from the underlying generating distribution lies outside the ball or subspace of values that are sensitive. The portion of each datum likelihood contribution deemed sensitive is then $(1-λ) \\leq 1$ and is the only portion of the likelihood subject to risk down-weighting. The second adjustment encodes knowledge as the difference in probability masses $P(R) \\leq 1$ between the edges of the sensitive range, $R$. We use the resulting conditional (pseudo) likelihood for a sensitive record, which boosts its worst case tail values away from 0. We compare privacy and utility properties for the PPM under the aDP and range restricted privacy standards."}

However, in many practical settings, network data is either unavailable, incomplete, or measured with substantial error. We demonstrate that causal message passing, a methodology that leverages temporal structure in outcome data rather than network topology, can recover total treatment effects comparable to network-aware approaches. We apply causal message passing to two large-scale field experiments where a recently developed bipartite graph methodology, which requires network knowledge, serves as a benchmark. Despite having no access to the interaction network, causal message passing produces effect estimates that match the network-aware approach in direction across all metrics and in statistical significance for the primary decision metric. Our findings validate the premise of causal message passing: that temporal variation in outcomes can serve as an effective substitute for network observation when estimating spillover effects. This has important practical implications: practitioners facing settings where network data is costly to collect, proprietary, or unreliable can instead exploit the temporal dynamics of their experimental data."}

A reasoning probe has access to a sampled subset of internal computation nodes, possibly without covering the entire graph, and seeks to infer which $ν$-ary Boolean gate is executed at each queried node, representing uncertainty via a probability distribution over a fixed collection of $\\mathtt{m}$ admissible $ν$-ary gates. This partial observability induces a generalization problem, which we analyze in a realizable, transductive setting.\n  We show that, when the reasoning probe is parameterized by a graph convolutional network (GCN)-based hypothesis class and queries $N$ nodes, the worst-case generalization error attains the optimal rate $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\log(2/δ)}/\\sqrt{N})$ with probability at least $1-δ$, for $δ\\in (0,1)$.

We study performative predictions that affect a sample (e.g., only existing users of an app) and/or the whole population (e.g., all potential app users). This raises the question of how well models generalize under performativity. For example, how well can we draw insights about new app users based on existing users when both of them react to the app's predictions? We address this question by embedding performative predictions into statistical learning theory. We prove generalization bounds under performative effects on the sample, on the population, and on both. A key intuition behind our proofs is that in the worst case, the population negates predictions, while the sample deceptively fulfills them. We cast such self-negating and self-fulfilling predictions as min-max and min-min risk functionals in Wasserstein space, respectively. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between performatively changing the world and learning from it: the more a model affects data, the less it can learn from it. Moreover, our analysis results in a surprising insight on how to improve generalization guarantees by retraining on performatively distorted samples. We illustrate our bounds in a case study on prediction-informed assignments of unemployed German residents to job trainings, drawing upon administrative labor market records from 1975 to 2017 in Germany."}

Our main contribution is the use of a lexicographic order for the optimization problem that prioritizes parsimony. We analyze the computational complexity of the resulting procedure, which ranges from linear to cubic time depending on the chosen cost and validity functions, the data regime and the number of detected changes. Finally, we assess the quality of SVP through comparisons with standard optimal partitioning algorithms, showing that SVP yields competitive segmentations while explicitly enforcing segment validity. The flexibility of SVP makes it applicable to a broad class of problems; as an illustration, we demonstrate robust change-point detection by encoding robustness in the validity criterion."}

Subgroup analysis allows practitioners to pinpoint populations for whom a treatment is especially beneficial or protective, thereby advancing targeted interventions. Tree based recursive partitioning methods are widely used for subgroup analysis due to their interpretability. Nevertheless, these approaches encounter significant limitations, including suboptimal partitions induced by greedy heuristics and overfitting from locally estimated splits, especially under limited sample sizes. To address these limitations, we propose a fused optimal causal tree method that leverages mixed integer optimization (MIO) to facilitate precise subgroup identification. Our approach ensures globally optimal partitions and introduces a parameter fusion constraint to facilitate information sharing across related subgroups. This design substantially improves subgroup discovery accuracy and enhances statistical efficiency. We provide theoretical guarantees by rigorously establishing out of sample risk bounds and comparing them with those of classical tree based methods.

To address this, cluster-level randomization has become standard, enabling the use of network-aware estimators. These estimators typically trim the data to retain only a subset of informative units, achieving low bias under suitable conditions but often suffering from high variance. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the interior nodes - units whose neighbors all lie within the same cluster - constitute the vast majority of the post-trimming subpopulation. In light of this, we propose directly averaging over the interior nodes to construct the mean-in-interior (MII) estimator, which circumvents the delicate reweighting required by existing network-aware estimators and substantially reduces variance in classical settings. However, we show that interior nodes are often not representative of the full population, particularly in terms of network-dependent covariates, leading to notable bias. We then augment the MII estimator with a counterfactual predictor trained on the entire network, allowing us to adjust for covariate distribution shifts between the interior nodes and full population. By rearranging the expression, we reveal that our augmented MII estimator embodies an analytical form of the point estimator within prediction-powered inference framework. This insight motivates a semi-supervised lens, wherein interior nodes are treated as labeled data subject to selection bias. Extensive and challenging simulation studies demonstrate the outstanding performance of our augmented MII estimator across various settings."}

This paper studies the contextual bandit problem under a uniform $(1-δ)$-fairness constraint, and addresses its unique vulnerabilities to strategic manipulation. The fairness constraint ensures that preferential treatment is strictly justified by an arm's actual reward across all contexts and time horizons, using uniformity to prevent statistical loopholes. We develop novel algorithms that achieve (nearly) minimax-optimal regret for both linear and smooth reward functions, while maintaining strong $(1-\\tilde{O}(1/T))$-fairness guarantees, and further characterize the theoretically inherent yet asymptotically marginal \"price of fairness\". However, we reveal that such merit-based fairness becomes uniquely susceptible to signal manipulation. We show that an adversary with a minimal $\\tilde{O}(1)$ budget can not only degrade overall performance as in traditional attacks, but also selectively induce insidious fairness-specific failures while leaving conspicuous regret measures largely unaffected. To counter this, we design robust variants incorporating corruption-adaptive exploration and error-compensated thresholding. Our approach yields the first minimax-optimal regret bounds under $C$-budgeted attack while preserving $(1-\\tilde{O}(1/T))$-fairness. Numerical experiments and a real-world case demonstrate that our algorithms sustain both fairness and efficiency."}

We propose a distributed convoluted rank regression (DCRR) framework that constructs a similar surrogate loss and demonstrate its validity under the non-additive losses. We show that this surrogate shares the same population minimizer as the full-data CRR loss and yields estimators that are statistically equivalent to centralized CRR. Building on this, we develop a two-stage sparse DCRR procedure -- an iterative $\\ell_1$-penalized stage followed by a folded-concave refinement -- and establish non-asymptotic error bounds, a distributed strong oracle property, and a DHBIC-type criterion for consistent model selection.

Analyses often link network structure to node-level covariates, but existing methods falter with sparse networks and high-dimensional node features. We propose a joint latent space modeling framework for sparse networks with high-dimensional binary node covariates that performs covariate selection while accounting for uncertainty in estimated latent positions. Building on joint latent space models that couple edges and node variables through shared latent positions, we introduce a group lasso screening step and incorporate a measurement-error-aware stabilization term to mitigate bias from using estimated latent positions as predictors. We establish prediction error rates for the covariate component both when latent positions are treated as observed and when they are estimated with bounded error; under uniform control across $q$ covariates and $n$ nodes, the rate is of order $O(\\log q / n)$ up to an additional term due to latent position estimation error. Our method addresses three challenges: (1) incorporating information from isolated nodes, which are common in sparse networks but often ignored; (2) selecting relevant covariates from high-dimensional spaces; and (3) accounting for uncertainty in estimated latent positions. Simulations show predictive performance remains stable as covariate sparsity grows, while naive approaches degrade. We illustrate how the method can support efficient study design using household social networks from 75 Indian villages, where an emulated pilot study screens a large covariate battery and substantially reduces required subsequent data collection without sacrificing network predictive accuracy."}

This framework unlocks significant computational and statistical advantages in practice, enabling us to (i) quantify the convergence rate of the discretization error, (ii) calibrate the entropic regularization of Sinkhorn divergences to the data's intrinsic geometry, and (iii) introduce a novel, intrinsic-dimension-based Richardson extrapolation estimator that strongly debiases Wasserstein distance estimation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our geometry-aware pipeline effectively mitigates the discretization error bottleneck while maintaining computational efficiency."}

Widely mandated by environmental regulatory bodies globally, SSD has faced criticism due to its historical reliance on parametric assumptions when modeling species variability. By adopting nonparametric mixture models, we address this limitation, establishing a statistically robust foundation for SSD. Our BNP approach offers several advantages, including its efficacy in handling small datasets or censored data, which are common in ecological risk assessment, and its ability to provide principled uncertainty quantification alongside simultaneous density estimation and clustering. We utilize a specific nonparametric prior as the mixing measure, chosen for its robust clustering properties, a crucial consideration given the lack of strong prior beliefs about the number of components. Through simulation studies and analysis of real datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of our BNP-SSD over classical SSD methods. We also provide a BNP-SSD Shiny application, making our methodology available to the Ecotoxicology community. Moreover, we exploit the inherent clustering structure of the mixture model to explore patterns in species sensitivity. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of the proposed approach in improving ecological risk assessment methodologies."}

This paper introduces a method that generates personalized sequences of exercises by selecting, at each step, the exercise most likely to advance a learner's understanding of a targeted skill. The method uses information about the learner and their past performance to guide these choices, and learning progress is measured as the change in estimated skill level before and after each exercise. Using data from an online mathematics tutoring platform, we find that the approach recommends exercises associated with greater skill improvement and adapts effectively to differences across learners. From an instructional perspective, the framework enables personalized practice at scale, highlights exercises with consistently strong learning value, and helps instructors identify learners who may benefit from additional support."}

To address this, we develop a closed-form likelihood for discretely observed incidence count data under the dynamical survival analysis (DSA) paradigm. The method approximates the stochastic population-level hazard by a large population limit while retaining a count-valued stochastic model, and leads to survival analytic inferential strategies that are both computationally efficient and flexible to model generalizations. Through simulation, we show that parameter estimation is competitive with recent exact but computationally expensive likelihood-based methods in partially observed settings. Previous work has shown that the DSA approximation is generalizable, and we show that the inferential developments here also carry over to models featuring individual heterogeneity, such as frailty models.

We study performative predictions that affect a sample (e.g., only existing users of an app) and/or the whole population (e.g., all potential app users). This raises the question of how well models generalize under performativity. For example, how well can we draw insights about new app users based on existing users when both of them react to the app's predictions? We address this question by embedding performative predictions into statistical learning theory. We prove generalization bounds under performative effects on the sample, on the population, and on both. A key intuition behind our proofs is that in the worst case, the population negates predictions, while the sample deceptively fulfills them. We cast such self-negating and self-fulfilling predictions as min-max and min-min risk functionals in Wasserstein space, respectively. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between performatively changing the world and learning from it: the more a model affects data, the less it can learn from it. Moreover, our analysis results in a surprising insight on how to improve generalization guarantees by retraining on performatively distorted samples. We illustrate our bounds in a case study on prediction-informed assignments of unemployed German residents to job trainings, drawing upon administrative labor market records from 1975 to 2017 in Germany."}

Because both assumptions are frequently invalid, estimators more aligned with real-world settings have been proposed. An effect can be estimated as the difference in areas below the cumulative incidence functions of two groups up to a pre-specified time point. This approach, restricted mean time lost (RMTL), can be used in settings with competing risks as well. We extend RMTL estimation for use in an understudied health policy application in Medicare. Medicare currently supports healthcare payment for over 69 million beneficiaries, most of whom are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans and receive insurance from private insurers. These insurers are prospectively paid by the federal government for each of their beneficiaries' anticipated health needs using an ordinary least squares linear regression algorithm. As all coefficients are positive and predictor variables are largely insurer-submitted health conditions, insurers are incentivized to upcode, or report more diagnoses than may be accurate. Such gaming is projected to cost the federal government $40 billion in 2025 alone without clear benefit to beneficiaries. We propose several novel estimators of coding intensity and possible upcoding in Medicare Advantage, including accounting for unreliable reporting. We demonstrate estimator performance in simulated data leveraging the National Institutes of Health's All of Us study and also develop an open source R package to simulate realistic labeled upcoding data, which were not previously available."}

This paper studies the contextual bandit problem under a uniform $(1-δ)$-fairness constraint, and addresses its unique vulnerabilities to strategic manipulation. The fairness constraint ensures that preferential treatment is strictly justified by an arm's actual reward across all contexts and time horizons, using uniformity to prevent statistical loopholes. We develop novel algorithms that achieve (nearly) minimax-optimal regret for both linear and smooth reward functions, while maintaining strong $(1-\\tilde{O}(1/T))$-fairness guarantees, and further characterize the theoretically inherent yet asymptotically marginal \"price of fairness\". However, we reveal that such merit-based fairness becomes uniquely susceptible to signal manipulation. We show that an adversary with a minimal $\\tilde{O}(1)$ budget can not only degrade overall performance as in traditional attacks, but also selectively induce insidious fairness-specific failures while leaving conspicuous regret measures largely unaffected. To counter this, we design robust variants incorporating corruption-adaptive exploration and error-compensated thresholding. Our approach yields the first minimax-optimal regret bounds under $C$-budgeted attack while preserving $(1-\\tilde{O}(1/T))$-fairness. Numerical experiments and a real-world case demonstrate that our algorithms sustain both fairness and efficiency."}

In this paper, we introduce the targeted synthetic control (TSC) method, a new two-stage estimator that directly estimates the counterfactual outcome. Specifically, our TSC method (1) yields a targeted debiasing estimator, in the sense that the targeted updating refines the initial weights to produce more stable weights; and (2) ensures that the final counterfactual estimation is a convex combination of observed control outcomes to enable direct interpretation of the synthetic control weights. TSC is flexible and can be instantiated with arbitrary machine learning models. Methodologically, TSC starts from an initial set of synthetic-control weights via a one-dimensional targeted update through the weight-tilting submodel, which calibrates the weights to reduce bias of weights estimation arising from pre-treatment fit. Furthermore, TSC avoids key shortcomings of existing methods (e.g., the augmented SCM), which can produce unbounded counterfactual estimates. Across extensive synthetic and real-world experiments, TSC consistently improves estimation accuracy over state-of-the-art SCM baselines."}

This paper formulates the optimisation of the IW-ELBO in Bures-Wasserstein space, a manifold of Gaussian distributions equipped with the 2-Wasserstein metric. We derive the Wasserstein gradient of the IW-ELBO and project it onto the Bures-Wasserstein space to yield a tractable algorithm for Gaussian VI.\n  A pivotal contribution of our analysis concerns the stability of the gradient estimator. While the SNR of the standard Euclidean gradient estimator is known to vanish as the number of importance samples $K$ increases, we prove that the SNR of the Wasserstein gradient scales favourably as $Ω(\\sqrt{K})$, ensuring optimisation efficiency even for large $K$.
