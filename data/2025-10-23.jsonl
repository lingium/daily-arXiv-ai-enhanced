To address this, we propose using Semi-Implicit\nVariational Inference (SIVI), a highly flexible Bayesian approximation method,\nfor scalable Bayesian spatial interpolation. We evaluated SIVI with a GP prior\nand a Nearest-Neighbour Gaussian Process (NNGP) prior compared to Automatic\nDifferentiation Variational Inference (ADVI), Pathfinder, and Hamiltonian Monte\nCarlo (HMC), the reference method in spatial statistics. Methods were compared\nbased on their predictive ability measured by the CRPS, the interval score, and\nthe negative log-predictive density across 50 replicates for both Gaussian and\nPoisson outcomes. SIVI-based methods achieved similar results to HMC, while\nbeing drastically faster. On average, for the Poisson scenario with 500\ntraining locations, SIVI reduced the computational time from roughly 6 hours\nfor HMC to 130 seconds.

Many practical\nchallenges arise from the infrequency and severity of these events, including\nthe considerable variance of simple sampling methods and the substantial\ncomputational cost of high-fidelity numerical simulations. Numerous data-driven\nmethods have recently been developed to tackle these challenges. However, a\ntypical assumption for the success of these methods is the occurrence of\nmultiple extreme events, either within the training dataset or during the\nsampling process. This leads to accurate models in regions of quiescent events\nbut with high epistemic uncertainty in regions associated with extremes. To\novercome this limitation, we introduce Extreme Event Aware (e2a or eta) or\n$\\eta$-learning which does not assume the existence of extreme events in the\navailable data. $\\eta$-learning reduces the uncertainty even in `uncharted'\nextreme event regions, by enforcing the extreme event statistics of an\nobservable indicative of extremeness during training, which can be available\nthrough qualitative arguments or estimated with unlabeled data. This type of\nstatistical regularization results in models that fit the observed data, while\nenforcing consistency with the prescribed observable statistics, enabling the\ngeneration of unprecedented extreme events even when the training data lack\nextremes therein.
