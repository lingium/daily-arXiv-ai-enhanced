Integrating these two sources of\ninformation is essential for uncovering interpretable links between descriptive\ncauses and their economic consequences. To this end, we develop a data-driven\nframework that constructs a composite Risk Index, enabling systematic\nquantification of how specific keywords relate to property damage amounts. This\nindex facilitates both the identification of high-impact terms and the\naggregation of risks across semantically related clusters, thereby offering a\nprincipled measure of fire-related financial risk. Using more than a decade of\nKorean fire investigation reports on the chemical industry classified as\nSpecial Buildings (2013 through 2024), we employ topic modeling and\nnetwork-based embedding to estimate semantic similarities from interactions\namong words and subsequently apply Lasso regression to quantify their\nassociations with property damage amounts, thereby estimate fire risk index.\nThis approach enables us to assess fire risk not only at the level of\nindividual terms but also within their broader textual context, where highly\ninteractive related words provide insights into collective patterns of hazard\nrepresentation and their potential impact on expected losses. The analysis\nhighlights several domains of risk, including hazardous chemical leakage,\nunsafe storage practices, equipment and facility malfunctions, and\nenvironmentally induced ignition.

Advances in\nprecision oncology have improved molecular profiling of individuals, and\ntailored therapies have led to more effective treatments for select patient\ngroups. However, treatment responses still vary among individuals. As cancer is\na heterogeneous and dynamic disease with varying treatment outcomes across\ndifferent molecular types and resistance mechanisms, it requires customized\napproaches to identify cause-and-effect relationships. N-of-1 trials, or\nsingle-subject clinical trials, are designed to evaluate individual treatment\neffects. Several works have described different causal frameworks to identify\ntreatment effects in N-of-1 trials, yet whether these approaches can be\nextended to single-cancer patient settings remains unclear. To explore this\npossibility, a longitudinal dataset from a single metastatic cancer patient\nwith adaptively chosen treatments was considered. The dataset consisted of a\ndetailed treatment plan as well as biomarker and lesion measurements recorded\nover time. After data processing, a treatment period with sufficient data\npoints to conduct causal inference was selected. Under this setting, a causal\nframework was applied to define an estimand, identify causal relationships and\nassumptions, and calculate an individual-specific treatment effect using a\ntime-varying g-formula. Through this application, we illustrate explicitly when\nand how causal treatment effects can be estimated in single-patient oncology\nsettings. Our findings not only demonstrate the feasibility of applying causal\nmethods in a single-cancer patient setting but also offer a blueprint for using\ncausal methods across a broader spectrum of cancer types in individualized\nsettings."}

This\nchallenge has motivated the development of stochastic incremental propensity\nscore interventions which operate on post-treatment exposures affected by the\ntreatment of interest with the aim of approximating the causal effects of the\ntreatment intervention. Yet, a key challenge lies in the fact that the precise\ndistributional shift of these post-treatment exposures induced by the treatment\nis typically unknown, making it uncertain whether the approximation truly\nreflects the causal effect of interest. The primary objective of this paper is\nto explore data integration methodologies to characterize a distribution of\npost-treatment exposures resulting from the treatment in an external dataset,\nand to use this information to estimate counterfactual mean outcomes under\ntreatment interventions, in settings where the observational data lack\ntreatment information and the external data may not contain measurements of the\noutcome of interest. We will discuss the underlying assumptions required for\nthis approach and provide methodological guidance on estimation strategies to\naddress these challenges."}

We derive precise generalization error formulae for\nminimum-$\\ell_2$-norm interpolation and ridge regression under this iterative\nscheme. Our analysis reveals intriguing properties of the optimal mixing weight\nthat minimizes long-term prediction error and provably prevents model collapse.\nFor instance, in the case of min-$\\ell_2$-norm interpolation, we establish that\nthe optimal real-data proportion converges to the reciprocal of the golden\nratio for fairly general classes of covariate distributions. Previously, this\nproperty was known only for ordinary least squares, and additionally in low\ndimensions. For ridge regression, we further analyze two popular model classes\n-- the random-effects model and the spiked covariance model -- demonstrating\nhow spectral geometry governs optimal weighting.

Its virtues lie in protection against partial nuisance\nmisspecification and asymptotic semiparametric efficiency under correct\nnuisance specification.

In\nfact, it has been amply verified empirically that these estimators can perform\npoorly when all nuisance functions are misspecified. Here, we first\ncharacterize this phenomenon of double fragility, and then propose a solution\nbased on adaptive correction clipping (ACC). We argue that our ACC proposal is\nsafe, in that it inherits the favorable properties of doubly robust estimators\nunder correct nuisance specification, but its error is guaranteed to be bounded\nby a convex combination of the individual nuisance model errors, which prevents\nthe instability caused by the compounding product of errors of doubly robust\nestimators. We also show that our proposal provides valid inference through the\nparametric bootstrap when nuisances are well-specified.
