This lack of real-world evaluation leaves unresolved practical questions about which adjustment methods to use and which covariates to include. To address this gap, we conduct a large-scale empirical benchmarking using individual-level data from 50 publicly accessible RCTs comprising 29,094 participants and 574 treatment-outcome pairs. We evaluate 18 analytical strategies formed by combining six estimators-including classical regression, inverse probability weighting, and machine-learning methods-with three covariate-selection rules. Across diverse therapeutic areas, covariate adjustment consistently improves precision, yielding median variance reductions of 13.3% relative to unadjusted analyses for continuous outcomes and 4.6% for binary outcomes. However, machine-learning algorithms implemented with default hyperparameter settings do not yield efficiency gains beyond simple linear models. Parsimonious regression approaches, such as analysis of covariance, deliver stable, reproducible performance even in moderate sample sizes. Together, these findings provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that transparent and parsimonious covariate adjustment is sufficient and often preferable for routine RCT analysis. All curated datasets and analysis code are openly released as a reproducible benchmark resource to support future clinical research and methodological development."}

In the subtraction method, an original network measure is adjusted by subtracting the expected value obtained from a surrogate ensemble, whereas in the division method, it is normalized by dividing by this expected value. However, to the best of our knowledge, no prior study has assessed whether these two correction approaches yield statistically different results. In this study, we constructed complex networks of extreme precipitation and temperature events (EPEs and ETEs) across the CONUS for both summer (June-August, JJA) and winter (December-February, DJF) seasons. We computed key network metrics degree centrality (DC), clustering coefficient (CC), mean geographic distance (MGD), and betweenness centrality (BC) and applied both correction methods. Although the corrected spatial patterns generally appeared visually similar, statistical analyses revealed that the network measures derived from the subtraction and division methods were significantly different at the 95 percent confidence level. Across the CONUS, network hubs of EPEs were primarily concentrated in the northwestern United States during summer and shifted toward the east during winter, reflecting seasonal differences in the dominant atmospheric drivers. In contrast, the ETE networks showed strong spatial coherence and pronounced regional teleconnections in both seasons, with higher connectivity and longer synchronization distances in winter, consistent with large-scale circulation patterns such as the Pacific-North American and North Atlantic Oscillation modes. Our results indicated that the network metrics CC and MGD were more sensitive to the correction methods than the DC and BC, particularly in the EPE networks."}

Accounting for individual differences in functional topography is also crucial for accurately distinguishing spatial and temporal aspects of brain organization. Yet, accurate estimation of individual functional brain networks from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) without extensive scanning remains challenging, due to low signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we describe Bayesian brain mapping (BBM), a technique for individual functional topography and connectivity leveraging population information. Population-derived priors for both spatial topography and functional connectivity based on existing spatial templates, such as parcellations or continuous network maps, are used to guide subject-level estimation and combat noise. BBM is highly flexible, avoiding strong spatial or temporal constraints and allowing for overlap between networks and heterogeneous patterns of engagement. Unlike multi-subject hierarchical models, BBM is designed for single-subject analysis, making it highly computationally efficient and translatable to clinical settings. Here, we describe the BBM model and illustrate the use of the BayesBrainMap R package to construct population-derived priors, fit the model, and perform inference to identify engagements. A demo is provided in an accompanying Github repo. We also share priors derived from the Human Connectome Project database and provide code to support the construction of priors from different data sources, lowering the barrier to adoption of BBM for studies of individual brain organization."}

However, modalities often contribute unequally and in a data dependent way, making it unclear which data modalities are genuinely informative and to what extent their contributions can be trusted. Quantifying modality level importance together with uncertainty is therefore central to interpretable and reliable multimodal learning. We introduce conformal Shapley intervals, a framework that combines Shapley values with conformal inference to construct uncertainty-aware importance intervals for each modality. Building on these intervals, we propose a modality selection procedure with a provable optimality guarantee: conditional on the observed features, the selected subset of modalities achieves performance close to that of the optimal subset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on multiple datasets, showing that it provides meaningful uncertainty quantification and strong predictive performance while relying on only a small number of informative modalities."}

We study resampling strategies tailored to ISO 5725 data and extend a bias-correction idea to obtain simple adjusted point estimators and confidence intervals for the variance components. Using extensive simulations that mirror realistic study sizes and variance ratios, we evaluate accuracy, stability, and coverage, and we contrast the resampling-based procedures with ANOVA-based estimators and common approximate intervals. The results yield a clear division of labor: adjusted within-laboratory resampling provides accurate and stable point estimation in small-to-moderate designs, whereas a two-stage strategy-resampling laboratories and then resampling within each-paired with bias-corrected and accelerated intervals offers the most reliable (near-nominal or conservative) confidence intervals. Performance degrades under extreme designs, such as very small samples or dominant between-laboratory variation, clarifying when additional caution is warranted. A case study from an ISO 5725-4 dataset illustrates how the recommended procedures behave in practice and how they compare with ANOVA and approximate methods. We conclude with concrete guidance for implementing resampling-based precision analysis in interlaboratory studies: use adjusted within-laboratory resampling for point estimation, and adopt the two-stage strategy with bias-corrected and accelerated intervals for interval estimation."}

They specified the GDRF as a parametric function of the treatment status only and proposed a weighted regression with the weighting function estimated using the maximum entropy approach. This paper specifies the GDRF as a nonparametric function of the treatment status, proposes a weighted local linear regression for estimating GDRF, and develops a bootstrap procedure for constructing the uniform confidence bands. We propose stable weights with minimum sample variance while eliminating the sample association between the treatment and the confounding variables. The proposed weights admit a closed-form expression, allowing them to be computed efficiently in the bootstrap sampling. Under certain conditions, we derive the uniform Bahadur representation for the proposed estimator of GDRF and establish the validity of the corresponding uniform confidence bands. A fully data-driven approach to choosing the undersmooth tuning parameters and a data-driven bias-control confidence band are included.

To address this, we propose a Prevalence Incidence Cure (PIC) model, a 3 component mixture model that combines the PI model framework with a cure model. Our PIC model enables estimation of the prevalence, time-to-incidence, and the cure proportion, and allows for covariates to affect these. We adopt a Bayesian inference approach, and focus on the interpretability of the prior. We show in a simulation study that the PIC model has smaller bias than a PI model for the survival probability; and compare inference under vague, informative and misspecified priors. We illustrate our model using a dataset of 1964 patients undergoing treatment for Diabetic Macular Oedema, demonstrating improved fit under the PIC model."}

Most theoretical analyses focus on regression or on classification tasks with a positive margin, where worst-case gradient bounds suffice. In contrast, we study zero-margin nonlinear classification by analyzing the Gaussian XOR problem, where inputs are Gaussian and the XOR decision boundary determines labels. In this setting, a non-negligible fraction of data lies arbitrarily close to the boundary, breaking standard margin-based arguments. Building on Glasgow's (2024) analysis, we extend the study of training dynamics from discrete to Gaussian inputs and develop a framework for the dynamics of neuron blocks. We show that neurons cluster into four directions and that block-level signals evolve coherently, a phenomenon essential in the Gaussian setting where individual neuron signals vary significantly. Leveraging this block perspective, we analyze generalization without relying on margin assumptions, adopting an average-case view that distinguishes regions of reliable prediction from regions of persistent error. Numerical experiments confirm the predicted two-phase block dynamics and demonstrate their robustness beyond the Gaussian setting."}

Simulating paths from these processes, particularly after conditioning on noisy observations of the latent path, remains a challenge. Existing methods often introduce bias through time-discretization, require involved rejection sampling or debiasing schemes or are restricted to a narrow family of diffusions. In this work, we propose an exact Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm that is applicable to a broad subset of all SDEs with unit diffusion coefficient; after suitable transformation, this includes an even larger class of multivariate SDEs and most 1-d SDEs. We develop a Gibbs sampling framework that allows exact MCMC for such diffusions, without any discretization error. We demonstrate how our MCMC methodology requires only fairly straightforward simulation steps. Our framework can be extended to include parameter simulation, and allows tools from the Gaussian process literature to be easily applied. We evaluate our method on synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating superior performance to particle MCMC approaches."}

To address such issue of excessive zeros, zero-inflated and hurdle models introduce additional parameters that explicitly account for excess zeros, thereby improving the joint representation of zero and positive claim outcomes. These models have further been extended with random effects to accommodate longitudinal dependence and unobserved heterogeneity. However, their consistency with fundamental probabilistic principles in insurance, particularly stochastic monotonicity, has not been formally examined. This paper provides a rigorous analysis showing that standard counting random-effect models for excessive zeros may violate this property, leading to inconsistencies in posterior credibility. We then propose new classes of counting random-effect models that both accommodate excessive zeros and ensure stochastic monotonicity, thereby providing fair and theoretically coherent credibility adjustments as claim histories evolve."}

Leveraging the cycle representation of permutations and the literature on exchangeable random partitions, we define, characterize, and study the structural and predictive properties of these probabilistic objects. A novel sequential metaphor, the position-aware generalized Chinese restaurant process, provides a constructive foundation for this theory and supports practical algorithmic design. Exchangeable random permutations offer flexible priors for a wide range of inferential problems centered on permutations. As an application, we develop a Bayesian model for graph matching that integrates a correlated stochastic block model with our novel class of priors. The cycle structure of the matching is linked to latent node partitions that explain connectivity patterns, an assumption consistent with the homogeneity requirement underlying the graph matching task itself. Posterior inference is performed through a node-wise blocked Gibbs sampler directly enabled by the proposed sequential construction. To summarize posterior uncertainty, we introduce perSALSO, an adaptation of SALSO to the permutation domain that provides principled point estimation and interpretable posterior summaries. Together, these contributions establish a unified probabilistic framework for modeling, inference, and uncertainty quantification over permutations."}

Interventions in dynamic systems alter not only outcome levels but also evolutionary dynamics -- changing persistence and transition laws. Our framework treats potential outcomes as entire trajectories, enabling causal estimands, identification conditions, and estimators to be formulated directly on path space. The resulting Dynamic Average Treatment Effect (DATE) characterizes how causal effects evolve through time and reduces to the classical average treatment effect under one period of time. For observational data, we derive a dynamic inverse-probability weighting estimator that is unbiased under dynamic ignorability and positivity. When treated units are scarce, we show that conditional mean trajectories underlying the DATE admit a linear state-space representation, yielding a dynamic linear model implementation. Simulations demonstrate that modeling time as intrinsic to the causal mechanism exposes dynamic effects that static methods systematically misestimate. An empirical study of COVID-19 lockdowns illustrates the framework's practical value for estimating and decomposing treatment effects."}

Our main results show that, uniformly across posterior cluster-growth regimes, the overhead induced by slice variables, relatively to the number of clusters supported by the posterior, is $O_{\\mathbb P}(\\log n)$. As a consequence, even in worst-case configurations, superlinear blow-ups in per-iteration computational cost occur with vanishing probability.

This paper proposes a graph-based framework for coverage analysis that represents traffic scenes as hierarchical graphs, combining map topology with actor relationships. The framework introduces a two-phase graph construction algorithm that systematically captures spatial relationships between traffic participants, including leading, following, neighboring, and opposing configurations. Two complementary coverage analysis methods are presented. First, a sub-graph isomorphism approach matches traffic scenes against a set of manually defined archetype graphs representing common driving scenarios. Second, a graph embedding approach utilizes Graph Isomorphism Networks with Edge features (GINE) trained via self-supervised contrastive learning to project traffic scenes into a vector space, enabling similarity-based coverage assessment. The framework is validated on both real-world data from the Argoverse 2.0 dataset and synthetic data from the CARLA simulator. The subgraph isomorphism method is used to calculate node coverage percentages using predefined archetypes, while the embedding approach reveals meaningful structure in the latent space suitable for clustering and anomaly detection. The proposed approach offers significant advantages over traditional methods by scaling efficiently to diverse traffic scenarios without requiring scenario-specific handling, and by naturally accommodating varying numbers of actors in a scene."}

However, most RL algorithms rely on the Markov Decision Process assumption, which is violated in practical cyber-physical systems affected by sensing delays, actuation latencies, and communication constraints. Such time delays introduce memory effects that can significantly degrade performance and compromise stability, particularly in networked and multi-agent environments. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of RL methods designed to address time delays in control systems. We first formalize the main classes of delays and analyze their impact on the Markov property. We then systematically categorize existing approaches into five major families: state augmentation and history-based representations, recurrent policies with learned memory, predictor-based and model-aware methods, robust and domain-randomized training strategies, and safe RL frameworks with explicit constraint handling. For each family, we discuss underlying principles, practical advantages, and inherent limitations. A comparative analysis highlights key trade-offs among these approaches and provides practical guidelines for selecting suitable methods under different delay characteristics and safety requirements. Finally, we identify open challenges and promising research directions, including stability certification, large-delay learning, multi-agent communication co-design, and standardized benchmarking. This survey aims to serve as a unified reference for researchers and practitioners developing reliable RL-based controllers in delay-affected cyber-physical systems."}

By parameterizing weights as $W = AB^{\\top}$ with $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times r}$, $B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times r}$, we induce a posterior that is singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure, concentrating on the rank-$r$ manifold. This singularity captures structured weight correlations through shared latent factors, geometrically distinct from mean-field's independence assumption. We derive PAC-Bayes generalization bounds whose complexity term scales as $\\sqrt{r(m+n)}$ instead of $\\sqrt{m n}$, and prove loss bounds that decompose the error into optimization and rank-induced bias using the Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem. We further adapt recent Gaussian complexity bounds for low-rank deterministic networks to Bayesian predictive means. Empirically, across MLPs, LSTMs, and Transformers on standard benchmarks, our method achieves predictive performance competitive with 5-member Deep Ensembles while using up to $15\\times$ fewer parameters. Furthermore, it substantially improves OOD detection and often improves calibration relative to mean-field and perturbation baselines."}

Next, we propose a spacings-based estimator for Tsallis entropy under progressive type-II censoring and study its performance using Monte Carlo simulations. Another estimator for Tsallis entropy is proposed using quantile function and its consistency and asymptotic normality are studied, and its performance is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations. Goodness-of-fit tests for normal and exponential distributions as applications are developed using Tsallis divergence measure. The performance of the proposed tests are then compared with some known tests using simulations and it is shown that the proposed tests perform very well.

While many existing alignment methods primarily focus on fine-tuning pre-trained generative models to maximize a given reward function, these approaches require extensive computational resources and may not generalize well across different objectives. In this work, we propose a novel alignment framework by leveraging the underlying nature of the alignment problem -- sampling from reward-weighted distributions -- and show that it applies to both diffusion models (via score guidance) and flow matching models (via velocity guidance). The score function (velocity field) required for the reward-weighted distribution can be decomposed into the pre-trained score (velocity field) plus a conditional expectation of the reward. For the alignment on the diffusion model, we identify a fundamental challenge: the adversarial nature of the guidance term can introduce undesirable artifacts in the generated images. Therefore, we propose a finetuning-free framework that trains a guidance network to estimate the conditional expectation of the reward. We achieve comparable performance to finetuning-based models with one-step generation with at least a 60% reduction in computational cost. For the alignment on flow matching, we propose a training-free framework that improves the generation quality without additional computational cost."}

To address this challenge, we propose learning state policies that recommend desirable next-state transitions rather than actions. Our contributions are twofold. First, we introduce a simple yet novel state discretisation transformation and propose Offline State-Only DecQN (\\algo), a value-based algorithm designed to pre-train state policies from action-free data. \\algo{} integrates the transformation to scale efficiently to high-dimensional problems while avoiding instability and overfitting associated with continuous state prediction. Second, we propose a novel mechanism for guided online learning that leverages these pre-trained state policies to accelerate the learning of online agents. Together, these components establish a scalable and practical framework for leveraging action-free datasets to accelerate online RL.

Email: fl35@duke.edu", "summary": "The doubly-robust (DR) estimator is popular for evaluating causal effects in observational studies and is often perceived as more desirable than inverse probability weighting (IPW) or outcome modeling alone because it provides extra protection against model misspecification. However, double robustness is an asymptotic property that may not hold in finite samples. We investigate how the finite sample performance of the DR estimator depends on the degree of covariate overlap between comparison groups. Using analytical illustrations and extensive simulations under various scenarios with different degrees of covariate overlap and model specifications, we examine the bias and variance of the DR estimator relative to IPW and outcome modeling estimators. We find that: (i) specification of the outcome model has a stronger influence on the DR estimates than specification of the propensity score model, and this dominance increases as overlap decreases; (ii) with poor overlap, the DR estimator generally amplifies the adverse consequences of extreme weights (large bias and/or variance) regardless of model specifications, and is often inferior to both the IPW and outcome modeling estimators. As a practical guide, we recommend always first checking the degree of overlap in applications. In the case of poor overlap, analysts should consider shifting the target population to a subpopulation with adequate overlap via methods such as trimming or overlap weighting."}

Considering Gaussian mixtures and their exact scores, and leveraging tools from statistical physics, we characterize the onset of distortion in a high-dimensional regime as a function of the number of classes. Our analysis reveals that distortions emerge through a phase transition in the effective potential governing the guided dynamics. In particular, our dynamical mean-field analysis shows that distortion persists when the number of modes grows exponentially with dimension, but vanishes in the sub-exponential regime. Consistent with prior finite-dimensional results, we further demonstrate that vanilla CFG shifts the mean and shrinks the variance of the conditional distribution. We show that standard CFG schedules are fundamentally incapable of preventing variance shrinkage.

These zero-slope regions, which vary by quantile, indicate times when the functional predictor has no discernible impact on the response variable. This feature boosts the model's interpretability. Unlike traditional FQR models, which fit one quantile at a time and have several limitations, our proposed method can handle a spectrum of quantiles simultaneously. We tested the new approach through simulation studies, demonstrating its clear advantages over standard techniques.

We introduce feature-wise (d-rectangular) uncertainty sets, which preserve tractable robust Bellman recursions while maintaining key cross-site structure.

Crucially, direct access to the Hessian reveals that widely used block-diagonal curvature approximations can fail catastrophically, exhibiting order-one relative error and poor directional alignment even in mid-scale LLMs. Together, our results demonstrate that foundation-model Hessian spectra are both computable and qualitatively misrepresented by prevailing approximations, opening the door to principled curvature-based analysis at scale."}

A novel sequential metaphor, the position-aware generalized Chinese restaurant process, provides a constructive foundation for this theory and supports practical algorithmic design. Exchangeable random permutations offer flexible priors for a wide range of inferential problems centered on permutations. As an application, we develop a Bayesian model for graph matching that integrates a correlated stochastic block model with our novel class of priors. The cycle structure of the matching is linked to latent node partitions that explain connectivity patterns, an assumption consistent with the homogeneity requirement underlying the graph matching task itself. Posterior inference is performed through a node-wise blocked Gibbs sampler directly enabled by the proposed sequential construction. To summarize posterior uncertainty, we introduce perSALSO, an adaptation of SALSO to the permutation domain that provides principled point estimation and interpretable posterior summaries.

Using kernel ridge regression as an exact model of wide neural networks, we prove that clustered dirty label poisons induce a rank one spike in the input Hessian whose magnitude scales quadratically with attack efficacy. Crucially, for nonlinear kernels we identify a near clone regime in which poison efficacy remains order one while the induced input curvature vanishes, making the attack provably spectrally undetectable. We further show that input gradient regularisation contracts poison aligned Fisher and Hessian eigenmodes under gradient flow, yielding an explicit and unavoidable safety efficacy trade off by reducing data fitting capacity. For exponential kernels, this defence admits a precise interpretation as an anisotropic high pass filter that increases the effective length scale and suppresses near clone poisons. Extensive experiments on linear models and deep convolutional networks across MNIST and CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100 validate the theory, demonstrating consistent lags between attack success and spectral visibility, and showing that regularisation and data augmentation jointly suppress poisoning.

In this article, we propose a semiparametric framework for causal inference with derived outcomes obtained after intra-subject processing. This framework applies to settings with a modular structure, where intra-subject analyses are conducted independently across subjects and are followed by inter-subject analyses based on parameters from the intra-subject stage. We develop multiply robust estimators of causal parameters under rate conditions on both intra-subject and inter-subject models, which allows the use of flexible machine learning. We specialize the framework to a mediation setting and focus on the natural direct effect. For high dimensional inference, we employ a step-down procedure that controls the exceedance rate of the false discovery proportion.

The average treatment effect is defined as difference of value functions over an infinite horizon, which accounts for cumulative treatment effects, both immediate and carryover. The proposed method outperforms existing testing procedures such as discrete time reinforcement learning strategies in multi-resolution observation settings where observation times can be irregular. Another advantage of the proposed method is that it can capture treatment effects of a shorter duration and provide greater accuracy compared to discrete-time approximations, through the use of continuous-time estimation for the value function. We establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed test statistics and apply it to OhioT1DM diabetes data to evaluate the cumulative treatment effects of bolus insulin on patients' glucose levels."}

While nonparametric identification of smooth functionals of the treatment-free potential outcome among the treated, such as the average treatment effect on the treated, has been established under this model, corresponding nonparametric efficient estimation has proven elusive due to variationally dependent nuisance parameters defined in terms of counterfactual quantities. To address this challenge, we introduce a new variationally independent parameterization based on nuisance functions defined directly from the observed data. This parameterization, coupled with a novel fixed-point argument, enables the use of modern machine learning methods for nuisance function estimation. We characterize the semiparametric efficiency bound for any smooth functional of the treatment-free potential outcome among the treated and construct a corresponding semiparametric efficient estimator without imposing any unnecessary restriction on nuisance functions. Furthermore, we describe a straightforward generative model justifying our identifying assumptions and characterize empirically falsifiable implications of the framework to evaluate our assumptions in practical settings. Our approach seamlessly extends to nonlinear treatment effects, population-level effects, and nonignorable missing data settings.

We formalize this setting and present a general confidence sequence framework for SWF-based online learning and inference, valid for any monotonic, concave, and Lipschitz-continuous SWF. Our key insight is that monotonicity alone suffices to lift confidence sequences from individual utilities to anytime-valid bounds on optimal welfare. Building on this foundation, we propose SWF-UCB, a SWF-agnostic online learning algorithm that achieves near-optimal $\\tilde{O}(n+\\sqrt{nkT})$ regret (for $k$ resources distributed among $n$ individuals at each of $T$ time steps).

This approach requires the confounder interactions and their functional relationships with disease risk to be specified in advance, rather than being learned from the data. Therefore, this paper proposes the SPAR-Forest-ERF algorithm, which is the first fusion of random forests for capturing non-linear and interacting confounder-response effects with Bayesian spatial autocorrelation models that can estimate interpretable exposure response functions (ERF) with full uncertainty quantification. Methodologically, we extend existing methods set in a prediction context by propagating uncertainty between both the ML and statistical models, developing a new stopping criteria designed to ensure the stability of the primary inferential target, and incorporating a range of different ERFs for maximum model flexibility.

While REINFORCE gradient estimators do not suffer from such restrictions, they lack rigorous theoretical justification. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of REINFORCE gradient estimators in importance weighted VI, leveraging this theoretical foundation to diagnose and resolve fundamental deficiencies in current state-of-the-art estimators.

When estimating a single entry P_ij, the neighborhood of node i is constructed from an adjacency matrix in which the jth row and column are set to zero, thereby decoupling neighborhood selection from the edges being averaged. We show that this construction restores conditional independence of the centered summands, enabling the use of classical probabilistic tools for inference.\n  Under piecewise Lipschitz graphon assumptions and logarithmic degree growth, we derive variance-adaptive concentration inequalities based on Bousquet's inequality and establish Berry-Esseen bounds with explicit rates for the normalized estimation error. These results yield both finite-sample and asymptotic confidence intervals for individual edge probabilities. The same leave-one-out structure also supports an honest cross-validation scheme for tuning parameter selection, for which we prove an oracle inequality.

Nevertheless, there are three notable concerns that have not been addressed in the literature, namely (i) the benefits of the sigmoid gate have not been established under classification settings; (ii) existing sigmoid-gated MoE models may not converge to their ground-truth; and (iii) the effects of a temperature parameter in the sigmoid gate remain theoretically underexplored. To tackle these open problems, we perform a comprehensive analysis of multinomial logistic MoE equipped with a modified sigmoid gate to ensure model convergence. Our results indicate that the sigmoid gate exhibits a lower sample complexity than the softmax gate for both parameter and expert estimation. Furthermore, we find that incorporating a temperature into the sigmoid gate leads to a sample complexity of exponential order due to an intrinsic interaction between the temperature and gating parameters.

This perspective reveals a major drawback: standard EDL conflates epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, leading to systematic overconfidence on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. To address this, we introduce Density-Informed Pseudo-count EDL (DIP-EDL), a new parametrization that decouples class prediction from the magnitude of uncertainty by separately estimating the conditional label distribution and the marginal covariate density. This separation preserves evidence in high-density regions while shrinking predictions toward a uniform prior for OOD data. Theoretically, we prove that DIP-EDL achieves asymptotic concentration.

In this work, we take an alternative perspective and study missing data from a privacy preservation standpoint. Intuitively, when features are missing, less information is revealed about individuals, suggesting that missingness could inherently enhance privacy. We formalize this intuition by analyzing missing data as a privacy amplification mechanism within the framework of differential privacy. We show, for the first time, that incomplete data can yield privacy amplification for differentially private algorithms."}

Despite the success of machine learning methods in learning SDE dynamics, existing approaches either require expensive neural network training for score function estimation or lack the ability to handle continuous parameter dependence. We present a training-free conditional diffusion model framework for learning stochastic flow maps of parameter-dependent SDEs, where both drift and diffusion coefficients depend on physical parameters. The key technical innovation is a joint kernel-weighted Monte Carlo estimator that approximates the conditional score function using trajectory data sampled at discrete parameter values, enabling interpolation across both state space and the continuous parameter domain. Once trained, the resulting generative model produces sample trajectories for any parameter value within the training range without retraining, significantly accelerating parameter studies, uncertainty quantification, and real-time filtering applications. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated via three numerical examples of increasing complexity, showing accurate approximation of conditional distributions across varying parameter values."}

Considering the expressivity of two-layer neural networks, we first construct the data model as a generative two-layer NN where the activation function is expanded by using Hermite polynomials. This allows us to achieve interpretable control over high-order cumulants such as skewness and kurtosis through the Hermite coefficients while keeping the data model realistic. Using samples generated from the data model, we perform controlled online learning experiments with a two-layer NN. Our results reveal a moment-wise progression in training: networks first capture low-order statistics such as mean and covariance, and progressively learn high-order cumulants. Finally, we pretrain the generative model on the Fashion-MNIST dataset and leverage the generated samples for further experiments. The results of these additional experiments confirm our conclusions and show the utility of the data model in a real-world scenario. Overall, our proposed approach bridges simplified data assumptions and practical data complexity, which offers a principled framework for investigating distributional effects in machine learning and signal processing."}

While convergence rates for estimating the embedding of a single measure from $m$ samples are well understood, the literature has not addressed the setting involving multiple measures. In this paper, we study PCA in a double asymptotic regime where $n$ probability measures are observed, each through $m$ samples. We derive convergence rates of the form $n^{-1/2} + m^{-α}$ for the empirical covariance operator and the PCA excess risk, where $α>0$ depends on the chosen embedding. This characterizes the relationship between the number $n$ of measures and the number $m$ of samples per measure, revealing a sparse (small $m$) to dense (large $m$) transition in the convergence behavior. Moreover, we prove that the dense-regime rate is minimax optimal for the empirical covariance error. Our numerical experiments validate these theoretical rates and demonstrate that appropriate subsampling preserves PCA accuracy while reducing computational cost."}

Our approach learns a conditional generative model separately for each source domain and calibrates the generated responses to the target domain via conditional quantile matching. This distributional alignment step corrects general discrepancies between source and target domains without imposing restrictive assumptions such as covariate or label shift. The resulting framework provides a principled and flexible approach to high-quality data augmentation for downstream learning tasks in the target domain. From a theoretical perspective, we show that an empirical risk minimizer (ERM) trained on the augmented dataset achieves a tighter excess risk bound than the target-only ERM under mild conditions. In particular, we establish new convergence rates for the quantile matching estimator that governs the transfer bias-variance tradeoff. From a practical perspective, extensive simulations and real data applications demonstrate that the proposed method consistently improves prediction accuracy over target-only learning and competing transfer learning methods."}

Existing guarantees focus on the simple case of a one-dimensional (scalar) hyperparameter. This leaves the practically important, multi-dimensional hyperparameter tuning setting unresolved. We address this open question by establishing the first general framework for establishing generalization guarantees for tuning multi-dimensional hyperparameters in data-driven settings. Our approach strengthens the generalization guarantee framework for semi-algebraic function classes by exploiting tools from real algebraic geometry, yielding sharper, more broadly applicable guarantees. We then extend the analysis to hyperparameter tuning using the validation loss under minimal assumptions, and derive improved bounds when additional structure is available. Finally, we demonstrate the scope of the framework with new learnability results, including data-driven weighted group lasso and weighted fused lasso."}

However, beyond linear regression, the theoretical advantage of full-batch gradient descent (GD, which always reuses all the data) over one-pass stochastic gradient descent (online SGD, which uses each data point only once) remains unclear. In this work, we consider learning a $d$-dimensional single-index model with a quadratic activation, for which it is known that one-pass SGD requires $n\\gtrsim d\\log d$ samples to achieve weak recovery. We first show that this $\\log d$ factor in the sample complexity persists for full-batch spherical GD on the correlation loss; however, by simply truncating the activation, full-batch GD exhibits a favorable optimization landscape at $n \\simeq d$ samples, thereby outperforming one-pass SGD (with the same activation) in statistical efficiency. We complement this result with a trajectory analysis of full-batch GD on the squared loss from small initialization, showing that $n \\gtrsim d$ samples and $T \\gtrsim\\log d$ gradient steps suffice to achieve strong (exact) recovery."}

A Decision-Theoretic Characterization of Loss-Based Updating", "comment": null, "summary": "Loss-based updating, including generalized Bayes, Gibbs, and quasi-posteriors, replaces likelihoods by a user-chosen loss and produces a posterior-like distribution via exponential tilt. We give a decision-theoretic characterization that separates \\emph{belief posteriors} --  conditional beliefs justified by the foundations of Savage and Anscombe-Aumann under a joint probability mode l-- from \\emph{decision posteriors} -- randomized decision rules justified by preferences over decision rules. We make explicit that a loss-based posterior coincides with ordinary Bayes if and only if the loss is, up to scale and a data-only term, negative log-likelihood. We then show that generalized marginal likelihood is not evidence for decision posteriors, and Bayes factors are not well-defined without additional structure. In the decision posterior regime, non-degenerate posteriors require nonlinear preferences over decision rules. Under sequential coherence and separability, these lead to an entropy-penalized variational representation yielding generalized Bayes as the optimal rule."}

This paper aims to learn robust sequential decision-making policies from such offline, multi-site datasets. To model cross-site uncertainty, we study distributionally robust MDPs with a group-linear structure: all sites share a common feature map, and both the transition kernels and expected reward functions are linear in these shared features. We introduce feature-wise (d-rectangular) uncertainty sets, which preserve tractable robust Bellman recursions while maintaining key cross-site structure. Building on this, we then develop an offline algorithm based on pessimistic value iteration that includes: (i) per-site ridge regression for Bellman targets, (ii) feature-wise worst-case (row-wise minimization) aggregation, and (iii) a data-dependent pessimism penalty computed from the diagonals of the inverse design matrices. We further propose a cluster-level extension that pools similar sites to improve sample efficiency, guided by prior knowledge of site similarity. Under a robust partial coverage assumption, we prove a suboptimality bound for the resulting policy. Overall, our framework addresses multi-site learning with heterogeneous data sources and provides a principled approach to robust planning without relying on strong state-action rectangularity assumptions."}

Risk"], "title": "Causal Inference for Preprocessed Outcomes with an Application to Functional Connectivity", "comment": "55 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables", "summary": "In biomedical research, repeated measurements within each subject are often processed to remove artifacts and unwanted sources of variation. The resulting data are used to construct derived outcomes that act as proxies for scientific outcomes that are not directly observable. Although intra-subject processing is widely used, its impact on inter-subject statistical inference has not been systematically studied, and a principled framework for causal analysis in this setting is lacking. In this article, we propose a semiparametric framework for causal inference with derived outcomes obtained after intra-subject processing. This framework applies to settings with a modular structure, where intra-subject analyses are conducted independently across subjects and are followed by inter-subject analyses based on parameters from the intra-subject stage. We develop multiply robust estimators of causal parameters under rate conditions on both intra-subject and inter-subject models, which allows the use of flexible machine learning. We specialize the framework to a mediation setting and focus on the natural direct effect. For high dimensional inference, we employ a step-down procedure that controls the exceedance rate of the false discovery proportion. Simulation studies demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach. We apply our method to estimate the impact of stimulant medication on brain connectivity in children with autism spectrum disorder."}
