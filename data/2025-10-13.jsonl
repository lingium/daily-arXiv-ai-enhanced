However, many real-world applications, from\nsignal interpolation to multi-column tabular predictions, require coherent\njoint distributions that capture dependencies between predictions. While purely\nautoregressive architectures efficiently generate such distributions, they\nsacrifice the flexible set-conditioning that makes these models powerful for\nmeta-learning. Conversely, the standard approach to obtain joint distributions\nfrom set-based models requires expensive re-encoding of the entire augmented\nconditioning set at each autoregressive step. We introduce a causal\nautoregressive buffer that preserves the advantages of both paradigms. Our\napproach decouples context encoding from updating the conditioning set. The\nmodel processes the context once and caches it. A dynamic buffer then captures\ntarget dependencies: as targets are incorporated, they enter the buffer and\nattend to both the cached context and previously buffered targets. This enables\nefficient batched autoregressive generation and one-pass joint log-likelihood\nevaluation. A unified training strategy allows seamless integration of\nset-based and autoregressive modes at minimal additional cost. Across synthetic\nfunctions, EEG signals, cognitive models, and tabular data, our method matches\npredictive accuracy of strong baselines while delivering up to 20 times faster\njoint sampling. Our approach combines the efficiency of autoregressive\ngenerative models with the representational power of set-based conditioning,\nmaking joint prediction practical for transformer-based probabilistic models."}

Linero"], "title": "Defensive Model Expansion for Robust Bayesian Inference", "comment": null, "summary": "Some applied researchers hesitate to use nonparametric methods, worrying that\nthey will lose power in small samples or overfit the data when simpler models\nare sufficient. We argue that at least some of these concerns are unfounded\nwhen nonparametric models are strongly shrunk towards parametric submodels. We\nconsider expanding a parametric model with a nonparametric component that is\nheavily shrunk toward zero. This construction allows the model to adapt\nautomatically: if the parametric model is correct, the nonparametric component\ndisappears, recovering parametric efficiency, while if it is misspecified, the\nflexible component activates to capture the missing signal. We show that this\nadaptive behavior follows from simple and general conditions. Specifically, we\nprove that Bayesian nonparametric models anchored to linear regression,\nincluding variants of Gaussian processes regression and Bayesian additive\nregression trees, consistently identify the correct parametric submodel when it\nholds and give asymptotically efficient inference for regression coefficients.\nIn simulations, we find that the \"general BART\" model performs identically to\ncorrectly specified linear regression when the parametric model holds, and\nsubstantially outperform it when nonlinear effects are present. This suggests a\npractical paradigm: \"defensive model expansion\" as a safeguard against model\nmisspecification."}

Our approach integrates (1)\na generative formulation to capture cross-view relationships with a\nsemi-supervised strategy, and (2) a discriminative task-oriented formulation to\nidentify relevant information for specific downstream objectives.

Submitted to Structural Safety (Elsevier) on 5\n  Oct 2025", "summary": "Engineering risk is concerned with the likelihood of failure and the\nscenarios when it occurs. The sensitivity of failure probability to change in\nsystem parameters is relevant to risk-informed decision making. Computing\nsensitivity is at least one level more difficult than the probability itself,\nwhich is already challenged by a large number of input random variables, rare\nevents and implicit nonlinear `black-box' response. Finite difference with\nMonte Carlo probability estimates is spurious, requiring the number of samples\nto grow with the reciprocal of step size to suppress estimation variance. Many\nexisting works gain efficiency by exploiting a specific class of input\nvariables, sensitivity parameters, or response in its exact or surrogate form.\nFor general systems, this work presents a theory and associated Monte Carlo\nstrategy for computing sensitivity using response values and gradients with\nrespect to sensitivity parameters. It is shown that the sensitivity at a given\nresponse threshold can be expressed via the expectation of response gradient\nconditional on the threshold. Determining the expectation requires conditioning\non the threshold that is a zero-probability event, but it can be resolved by\nthe concept of kernel smoothing. The proposed method offers sensitivity\nestimates for all response thresholds generated in a single Monte Carlo run. It\nis investigated in a number of examples featuring sensitivity parameters of\ndifferent nature. As response gradient becomes increasingly available, it is\nhoped that this work can provide the basis for embedding sensitivity\ncalculations with reliability in the same Monte Carlo run."}
