While this generalizes\nthe classical multi-armed bandit and has broad applicability, its scalability\nis limited by the high cost of combinatorial optimization, requiring oracle\nqueries at every round. To tackle this, we propose oracle-efficient frameworks\nthat significantly reduce oracle calls while maintaining tight regret\nguarantees. For the worst-case linear reward setting, our algorithms achieve\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret using only $O(\\log\\log T)$ oracle queries. We also\npropose covariance-adaptive algorithms that leverage noise structure for\nimproved regret, and extend our approach to general (non-linear) rewards.\nOverall, our methods reduce oracle usage from linear to (doubly) logarithmic in\ntime, with strong theoretical guarantees."}
