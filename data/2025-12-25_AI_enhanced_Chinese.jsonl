Words with symbol frequencies far from one half have smaller combinatorial richness and therefore appear less complex under the standard definition. In this paper an entropy-normalized complexity measure is introduced that divides the Kolmogorov complexity of a word by the empirical entropy of its observed distribution of zeros and ones. This adjustment isolates intrinsic descriptive complexity from the purely combinatorial effect of symbol imbalance. For Martin L\u00f6f random sequences under constructive exchangeable measures, the adjusted complexity grows linearly and converges to one. A pathological construction shows that regularity of the underlying measure is essential.

To comply with fair lending laws, these algorithms typically exclude legally protected characteristics, such as race and gender. Yet algorithmic underwriting can still inadvertently favor certain groups, prompting new questions about how to audit lending algorithms for potentially discriminatory behavior. Building on prior theoretical work, we introduce a profit-based measure of lending discrimination in loan pricing. Applying our approach to approximately 80,000 personal loans from a major U.S. fintech platform, we find that loans made to men and Black borrowers yielded lower profits than loans to other groups, indicating that men and Black applicants benefited from relatively favorable lending decisions. We trace these disparities to miscalibration in the platform's underwriting model, which underestimates credit risk for Black borrowers and overestimates risk for women. We show that one could correct this miscalibration -- and the corresponding lending disparities -- by explicitly including race and gender in underwriting models, illustrating a tension between competing notions of fairness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u7f8e\u56fd\u91d1\u878d\u79d1\u6280\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u8d37\u6b3e\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9ed1\u4eba\u548c\u7537\u6027\u501f\u6b3e\u4eba\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u8bef\u5224\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7fa4\u4f53\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u4f18\u60e0\u7684\u8d37\u6b3e\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e2d\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7b97\u6cd5\u8d37\u6b3e\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u4fe1\u8d37\u9886\u57df\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u7b97\u6cd5\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u53d7\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u79cd\u65cf\u3001\u6027\u522b\u7b49\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u504f\u8892\u67d0\u4e9b\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u8d37\u6b3e\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u6b67\u89c6\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5229\u6da6\u7684\u8d37\u6b3e\u6b67\u89c6\u8861\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e3b\u8981\u91d1\u878d\u79d1\u6280\u5e73\u53f0\u7ea680,000\u7b14\u4e2a\u4eba\u8d37\u6b3e\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u5bf9\u7537\u6027\u548c\u9ed1\u4eba\u501f\u6b3e\u4eba\u7684\u8d37\u6b3e\u5229\u6da6\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7fa4\u4f53\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f18\u60e0\u7684\u8d37\u6b3e\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b2\uff09\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u6e90\u4e8e\u5e73\u53f0\u627f\u9500\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bef\u5224\uff0c\u4f4e\u4f30\u4e86\u9ed1\u4eba\u501f\u6b3e\u4eba\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9ad8\u4f30\u4e86\u5973\u6027\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u660e\u786e\u5305\u542b\u79cd\u65cf\u548c\u6027\u522b\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ea0\u6b63\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bef\u5224\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u4e0d\u540c\u516c\u5e73\u6982\u5ff5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7d27\u5f20\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u8d37\u6b3e\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u95ee\u9898\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6d89\u53ca\u7279\u5f81\u6392\u9664\uff0c\u66f4\u5173\u952e\u7684\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u5728\u627f\u9500\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7ea0\u6b63\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bef\u5224\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6982\u5ff5\u5b58\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

Mixed models, which combine a fixed mean, expressed using independent predictors, with autocorrelated random errors, are used for inference, forecasting and filling in missing values in groundwater level time series. Estimating parameters of mixed models using maximum likelihood has high computational complexity. For large datasets, this leads to restrictive simplifying assumptions such as fixing certain free parameters in practical implementations. In this paper, we propose a method to jointly estimate all parameters of mixed models using the Whittle likelihood, a frequency-domain quasi-likelihood.

The critical gap must also exist in a person's mind and hence, together with the perceived gap, is a latent variable. Finally, it is also proposed that the critical gap is influenced by various exogenous variables such as subject and opposing vehicle types, and perceived waiting time. Mathematical models that (i) incorporate systematic and random distortions during the perception process and (ii) account for the effect of the various influencing variables are developed. The parameters of these models are estimated for two different gap acceptance data sets using the maximum likelihood technique. The data is collected as part of this study. The estimated parameters throw valuable insights into how these influencing variables affect the critical gap. The results corroborate the initial predictions on the nature of influence these variables must exert and give strength to the gap acceptance decision-making construct proposed here. This work also proposes a methodology to estimate a measurable/observable world emulator of the latent variable critical gap. The use of the emulator critical gap provides improved estimates of derived quantities like the average waiting time of subject vehicles. Finally, studies are also conducted to show that the number of rejected gaps can work as a reasonable surrogate for the influencing variable, waiting time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u95f4\u9699\u800c\u975e\u6d4b\u91cf\u95f4\u9699\u7684\u95f4\u9699\u63a5\u53d7\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u4e34\u754c\u95f4\u9699\u89c6\u4e3a\u53d7\u591a\u79cd\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u611f\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6027\u626d\u66f2\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u95f4\u9699\u63a5\u53d7\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4b\u91cf\u95f4\u9699\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u51b3\u7b56\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u4eba\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e94\u57fa\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u95f4\u9699\u3002\u4e34\u754c\u95f4\u9699\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5fc3\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\u4e5f\u662f\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u53d7\u8f66\u8f86\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u611f\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6027\u626d\u66f2\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u8f66\u8f86\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u7b49\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u5bf9\u4e34\u754c\u95f4\u9699\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u95f4\u9699\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5404\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e34\u754c\u95f4\u9699\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u521d\u59cb\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u7b49\u884d\u751f\u91cf\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u88ab\u62d2\u7edd\u95f4\u9699\u6570\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5408\u7406\u66ff\u4ee3\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u95f4\u9699\u7684\u95f4\u9699\u63a5\u53d7\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u9a7e\u9a76\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u901a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u6539\u8fdb\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Although the literature includes linear and near-linear time algorithms for the LAD line fitting problem, these methods are difficult to implement and, to our knowledge, lack maintained public implementations. As a result, practitioners often resort to linear programming (LP) based methods such as the simplex-based Barrodale-Roberts method and interior-point methods, or on iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approximation which does not guarantee exact solutions. To close this gap, we propose the Piecewise Affine Lower-Bounding (PALB) method, an exact algorithm for LAD line fitting. PALB uses supporting lines derived from subgradients to build piecewise-affine lower bounds, and employs a subdivision scheme involving minima of these lower bounds. We prove correctness and provide bounds on the number of iterations. On synthetic datasets with varied signal types and noise including heavy-tailed outliers as well as a real dataset from the NOAA's Integrated Surface Database, PALB exhibits empirical log-linear scaling. It is consistently faster than publicly available implementations of LP based and IRLS based solvers.

Existing approaches generally fall into two categories: (i) designs that optimize individualized sampling rules, where unit-specific probabilities are assigned and applied independently, and (ii) designs based on stratified sampling with simple random sampling within strata. Focusing on the logistic regression setting, we derive the asymptotic variances of estimators under both approaches and compare them numerically through extensive simulations and an application to data from the Vanderbilt Comprehensive Care Clinic cohort. Our results reinforce that stratified sampling is not merely an approximation to individualized sampling, showing instead that optimal stratified designs are often more efficient than optimal individualized designs through their elimination of between-stratum contributions to variance. These findings suggest that optimizing over the class of individualized sampling rules overlooks highly efficient sampling designs and highlight the often underappreciated advantages of stratified sampling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u62bd\u6837\u4e0e\u5206\u5c42\u62bd\u6837\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u5c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4\u6700\u4f18\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u80fd\u6d88\u9664\u5c42\u95f4\u65b9\u5dee\u8d21\u732e", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u5b50\u62bd\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u7c7b\uff1a\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u62bd\u6837\u89c4\u5219\uff08\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5355\u4f4d\u5206\u914d\u7279\u5b9a\u6982\u7387\uff09\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u62bd\u6837\uff08\u5728\u5c42\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u7b80\u5355\u968f\u673a\u62bd\u6837\uff09\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6bd4\u8f83\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u5dee\u5f02", "method": "\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e24\u79cd\u62bd\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u8303\u5fb7\u6bd4\u5c14\u7279\u7efc\u5408\u62a4\u7406\u8bca\u6240\u961f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u503c\u6bd4\u8f83", "result": "\u5206\u5c42\u62bd\u6837\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u62bd\u6837\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u5c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4\u6700\u4f18\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u80fd\u6d88\u9664\u5c42\u95f4\u65b9\u5dee\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u4f18\u5316\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u62bd\u6837\u89c4\u5219\u4f1a\u5ffd\u7565\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u62bd\u6837\u8bbe\u8ba1", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5c42\u62bd\u6837\u5177\u6709\u5e38\u88ab\u4f4e\u4f30\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u62bd\u6837\u89c4\u5219\u4f1a\u9519\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u62bd\u6837\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u62bd\u6837\u5728\u62bd\u6837\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027"}}

This chapter addresses these challenges in the context of infectious disease prediction, with a focus on predicting outbreaks in geographic regions that have historically reported zero cases. To this end, we present the detailed computational framework and experimental application of the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP), with demonstrated success in handling sparse count data in microbiome and ecological studies. The PHIBP's architecture, grounded in the concept of absolute abundance, systematically borrows statistical strength from related regions and circumvents the known sensitivities of relative-rate methods to zero counts. Through a series of experiments on infectious disease data, we show that this principled approach provides a robust foundation for generating coherent predictive distributions and for the effective use of comparative measures such as alpha and beta diversity. The chapter's emphasis on algorithmic implementation and experimental results confirms that this unified framework delivers both accurate outbreak predictions and meaningful epidemiological insights in data-sparse settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "PHIBP\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u6cca\u677e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u7edd\u5bf9\u4e30\u5ea6\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u4f20\u67d3\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u8ba1\u6570\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5386\u53f2\u96f6\u75c5\u4f8b\u5730\u533a\u7684\u75ab\u60c5\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7a00\u758f\u8ba1\u6570\u6570\u636e\u5728\u4f20\u67d3\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u5386\u53f2\u62a5\u544a\u96f6\u75c5\u4f8b\u7684\u5730\u7406\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u75ab\u60c5\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6cca\u677e\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u5370\u5ea6\u81ea\u52a9\u9910\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08PHIBP\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edd\u5bf9\u4e30\u5ea6\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4ece\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u501f\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u76f8\u5bf9\u901f\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u96f6\u8ba1\u6570\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "PHIBP\u5728\u4f20\u67d3\u75c5\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u03b1\u548c\u03b2\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7b49\u6bd4\u8f83\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u75ab\u60c5\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u8ba1\u6570\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u75ab\u60c5\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

The true positive rate at a fixed false positive rate and summary indices such as the area under the FROC curve are also commonly used as the figures of merit in the statistical evaluation of these studies.

Our primary objective is to mitigate bifurcation-related issues by preprocessing the training data to enhance reconstruction quality, particularly for small-scale network architectures. Specifically, we propose applying Gaussianization preprocessing to the training data to make the target distribution more closely resemble an independent Gaussian distribution, which serves as the initial density of the reconstruction process.

This paper introduces a Causal-Driven Attribution (CDA) framework that infers channel influence using only aggregated impression-level data, avoiding any reliance on user identifiers or click-path tracking. CDA integrates temporal causal discovery (using PCMCI) with causal effect estimation via a Structural Causal Model to recover directional channel relationships and quantify their contributions to conversions. Using large-scale synthetic data designed to replicate real marketing dynamics, we show that CDA achieves an average relative RMSE of 9.50% when given the true causal graph, and 24.23% when using the predicted graph, demonstrating strong accuracy under correct structure and meaningful signal recovery even under structural uncertainty.

To facilitate interpretation, post-hoc global variable importance measures (VIMs) are widely used to assign to each predictor or input variable a numerical score that represents the extent to which that predictor impacts the fitted model's response predictions across the training data. It is well known that the most common existing VIMs, namely marginal Shapley and marginal permutation-based methods, can produce unreliable results if the predictors are highly correlated, because they require extrapolation of the response at predictor values that fall far outside the training data. Conditional versions of Shapley and permutation VIMs avoid or reduce the extrapolation but can substantially deflate the importance of correlated predictors. For the related goal of visualizing the effects of each predictor when strong predictor correlation is present, accumulated local effects (ALE) plots were recently introduced and have been widely adopted. This paper presents a new VIM approach based on ALE concepts that avoids both the extrapolation and the VIM deflation problems when predictors are correlated. We contrast, both theoretically and numerically, ALE VIMs with Shapley and permutation VIMs. Our results indicate that ALE VIMs produce similar variable importance rankings as Shapley and permutation VIMs when predictor correlations are mild and more reliable rankings when correlations are strong. An additional advantage is that ALE VIMs are far less computationally expensive.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eALE\u7684\u65b0\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u91cf\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u65f6\u7684\u5916\u63a8\u548c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4f4e\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9ed1\u76d2\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u8fb9\u9645Shapley\u548c\u7f6e\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u91cf\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u65f6\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u5916\u63a8\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f4e\u4f30\u76f8\u5173\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7d2f\u79ef\u5c40\u90e8\u6548\u5e94\uff08ALE\uff09\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u65b0\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5916\u63a8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u4f4e\u4f30\u76f8\u5173\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "result": "ALE VIMs\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\u65f6\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u5f3a\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "ALE VIMs\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Existing methods for handling left truncation mostly rely on the (quasi-)independence assumption or the weaker conditional (quasi-)independence assumption which assumes that conditional on observed covariates, the left truncation time and the event time are independent on the observed region. In practice, however, our analysis of the Honolulu Asia Aging Study (HAAS) suggests that the conditional quasi-independence assumption may fail because measured covariates often serve only as imperfect proxies for the underlying mechanisms, such as latent health status, that induce dependence between truncation and event times. To address this gap, we propose a proximal weighting identification framework that admits the dependence-inducing factors may not be fully observed. We then construct an estimator based on the framework and study its asymptotic properties. We examine the finite sample performance of the proposed estimator by comprehensive simulations, and apply it to analyzing the cognitive impairment-free survival probabilities using data from the Honolulu Asia Aging Study.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5904\u7406\u5de6\u622a\u65ad\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\u5904\u7406\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u969c\u788d\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5904\u7406\u5de6\u622a\u65ad\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\uff08\u51c6\uff09\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\uff0c\u89c2\u6d4b\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u53ef\u80fd\u53ea\u662f\u6f5c\u5728\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6761\u4ef6\u51c6\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u56e0\u7d20", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8fd1\u7aef\u52a0\u6743\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bf1\u5bfc\u56e0\u7d20\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u6e10\u8fd1\u6027\u8d28", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7efc\u5408\u6a21\u62df\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6a80\u9999\u5c71\u4e9a\u6d32\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8ba4\u77e5\u969c\u788d\u65e0\u751f\u5b58\u6982\u7387", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8fd1\u7aef\u52a0\u6743\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5de6\u622a\u65ad\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b58\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5230\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5"}}
